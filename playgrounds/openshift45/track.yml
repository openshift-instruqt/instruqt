- assignment: "Before you get started we recommend reading the following tips. They\
    \ explain\na bit about how the playground environment is setup and what access\
    \ you have.\n\n## Logging in to the Cluster via Dashboard\n\nClick the [Console](https://console-openshift-console-[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com)\
    \ tab to open the dashboard. \n\nYou will then able able to login with admin permissions\
    \ with:\n\n* **Username:** ``admin``\n* **Password:** ``admin``\n\nOr as a standard\
    \ user with:\n\n* **Username:** ``developer``\n* **Password:** ``developer``\n\
    \n## Logging in to the Cluster via CLI\n\nWhen the OpenShift playground is created\
    \ you will be logged in initially as\na cluster admin (```\noc whoami\n```) on\
    \ the command line. This will allow you to perform\noperations which would normally\
    \ be performed by a cluster admin.\n\nBefore creating any applications, it is\
    \ recommended you login as a distinct\nuser. This will be required if you want\
    \ to log in to the web console and\nuse it.\n\nTo login to the OpenShift cluster\
    \ from the _Terminal_ run:\n\n```\noc login -u developer -p developer\n```\n\n\
    This will log you in using the credentials:\n\n* **Username:** ``developer``\n\
    * **Password:** ``developer``\n\nUse the same credentials to log into the web\
    \ console.\n\nIn order that you can still run commands from the command line as\
    \ a cluster\nadmin, the ``sudoer`` role has been enabled for the ``developer``\
    \ account.\nTo execute a command as a cluster admin use the ``--as system:admin``\
    \ option\nto the command. For example:\n\n```\noc get projects --as system:admin\n\
    ```\n\n## Creating your own Project\n\nTo create a new project called ``myproject``\
    \ run the command:\n\n```\noc new-project myproject\n```\n\nYou could instead\
    \ create the project from the web console. If you do this,\nto change to the project\
    \ from the command line run the command:\n\n```\noc project myproject\n```\n\n\
    ## Persistent Volume Claims\n\nPersistent volumes have been pre-created in the\
    \ playground environment.\nThese will be used if you make persistent volume claims\
    \ for an application.\nThe volume sizes are defined as 100Gi each, however you\
    \ are limited by how\nmuch disk space the host running the OpenShift environment\
    \ has, which is\nmuch less.\n\nTo view the list of available persistent volumes\
    \ you can run:\n\n```\noc get pv --as system:admin\n```\n\n## Builder Images and\
    \ Templates\n\nThe playground environment is pre-loaded with Source-to-Image (S2I)\
    \ builders\nfor Java (Wildfly), Javascript (Node.JS), Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.\n\
    Templates are also available for MariaDB, MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL and\nRedis.\n\
    \nYou can see the list of what is available, and what versions, under _Add to\n\
    Project_ in the web console, or by running from the command line:\n\n```\noc new-app\
    \ -L\n```\n\n## Running Images as a Defined User\n\nBy default OpenShift prohibits\
    \ images from running as the ``root`` user\nor as a specified user. Instead, each\
    \ project is assigned its own unique\nrange of user IDs that application images\
    \ have to run as.\n\nIf you attempt to run an arbitrary image from an external\
    \ image registry\nsuch a Docker Hub, which is not built to best practices, or\
    \ requires that\nit be run as ``root``, it may not work as a result.\n\nIn order\
    \ to run such an image, you will need to grant additional privileges\nto the project\
    \ you create to allow it to run an application image as any\nuser ID. This can\
    \ be done by running the command:\n\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid\
    \ -z default -n myproject --as system:admin\n```\n\n"

description: '## Goal


  Explore OpenShift version 4.5.


  ## Concepts


  * OpenShift Web Console

  *`oc` command line tool

  * OpenShift Projects and Applications

  * Your applications on OpenShift


  ## Use case


  You control an OpenShift cluster for one hour. You can deploy your own container
  image, or set up a pipeline to build your application from source, then monitor
  it with Prometheus as it runs. Use an Operator to deploy and manage a database backend
  for your web app.


  This OpenShift cluster will self-destruct in one hour.
