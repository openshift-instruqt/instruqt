title: Quarkus for Spring Boot Developers
description: |-
  This track demonstrates how Spring and Spring Boot developers can use Spring annotations for Spring Data, Web, and Dependency Injection when building Quarkus applications.


  |What you need to know before you start|
  |----|
  |In order to get full benefit from taking this track you should...<br>• Have experience programming applications in Java using the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) framework.<br>• Have a working knowledge of application programming using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). <br>• Some introductory experience creating Java/Maven applications using Quarkus|

  <br>

  Quarkus enables Spring developers to become productive quickly using their existing knowledge and familiarity of the Spring APIs.

  You'll build a simple application that uses Spring Data to integrate with an underlying database via JPA. Also. you'll inject beans using Spring DI and expose them as RESTful endpoints via Spring Rest.
