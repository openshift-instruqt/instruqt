- assignment: "## The callback-based trader\n\nLet\u2019s start with the callback\
    \ trader. This trader is developed using the raw Vert.x API and so callbacks.\
    \ To ease the readability of the code, we are going to use Vert.x `Future`. A\
    \ `Future` is a structure encapsulating a deferred result (or failure). Unlike\
    \ regular Java Future, Vert.x `Futures` are non-blocking (no `get` and `join`\
    \ methods). You needs to listen for the `Future` completion by attaching a `Handler`\
    \ indicating the result (success or failure). `Futures` provide a nice and simple\
    \ way to structure your code, but that\u2019s not all. It also provides high-level\
    \ operators such as `CompositeFuture.all` indicating the completion of a set of\
    \ Futures.\n\nFuture objects are created using Future.future(). To be notified\
    \ of the completion, you need to attach a Handler<AsyncResult>> using the Future.setHandler\
    \ method.\n\nOpen the `io.vertx.workshop.trader.impl.CallbackTraderVerticle` class\
    \ and fill in the code to complete TODOs 1 and 2.\n\n`compulsive-traders/src/main/java/io/vertx/workshop/trader/impl/CallbackTraderVerticle.java`\
    \ \n\nThe trader needs the Portfolio service and the market service (the message\
    \ source sending the market data). We cannot start the trading logic before having\
    \ retrieved both of them. Use a CompositeFuture to be notified when both are completed\
    \ (or one fails). A CompositeFuture is a Future, so attach a Handler to it that\
    \ call the initialize method.\n\n<pre class=\"file\" data-filename=\"compulsive-traders/src/main/java/io/vertx/workshop/trader/impl/CallbackTraderVerticle.java\"\

description: "## The compulsive traders\n\nLet\u2019s review the previous scenarios\
  \ to have a better view of the current status. In the quote-generator we have build\
  \ a verticle sending market data to the event bus. In the portfolio service, we\
  \ expose an event bus service to manage our portfolio. Traders are the missing link\
  \ between both. It implement the logic deciding when to buy and sell stocks. Traders\
  \ have only one goal: getting rich (or not\u2026\u200B)!\n\nIn this section, we\
  \ are going to develop 3 traders (following a stupid logic you can definitely improve):\n\
  \n* The first trader is developed with the raw Vert.x API (callbacks)\n\n* The second\
  \ trader is developer with RX Java 2 (reactive programming)\n\n* The third trader\
  \ is developed with Kotlin using co-routine\n\nIt gives you an overview of the different\
  \ programming style proposed by Vert.x, and let you decide which one you prefer.\
  \ Also notice that Vert.x supports JavaScript, Groovy, Ruby, Scala and Ceylon.\n\
  \n**1. Initialize katacoda environment**\n\nYou may have noticed a script running\
  \ in the terminal. This is getting the lab ready up to this scenario i.e. it is\
  \ \n1. Cloning the source code\n2. Initialize the OpenShift environment\n3. Build\
  \ and deploy the quote-generator scenario\n4. Build and deploy the portfolio-service\
  \ sceanrio\n5. Build and deploy the micro-trader-dashboard\n\n\n**2. Compulsive\
  \ and dumb traders**\n\nBefore seeing how these are implemented, let\u2019s explain\
  \ the absolutely illogic algorithm used by these traders:\n\nA compulsive trader\
  \ is choosing one company name and a number of shares (x)\n\nRandomly, it tries\
  \ to buy or sell x shares of the company\n\nIt does not check whether or not it\
  \ has enough shares or money, it just tries\u2026\u200B This logic is implemented\
  \ in ``io.vertx.workshop.trader.impl.TraderUtils``."
