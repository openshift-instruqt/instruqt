- assignment: "# Build your first application\n\nFor your convenience, this scenario\
    \ has been created with a base project using the Java programming language and\
    \ the Apache Maven build tool.\n\nFor educational purposes, this scenario uses\
    \ one single Java class named `HttpApplication.java`. Now open that file, by clicking\
    \ on the link below:\n\n``src/main/java/com/example/HttpApplication.java``{{open}}\n\
    \nAs you review the content, you will notice that there are a lot of **TODO**\
    \ comments. **Do not remove them!** These comments are used as a marker and without\
    \ them, you will not be able to finish this scenario.\n\nNotice that `HttpApplication`\
    \ class extends another class called `AbstractVerticle`. Before we start implementing\
    \ our logic, let's discuss a bit what a Verticle is.\n\n# What is a verticle?\n\
    Verticles \u2014 the Building Blocks of Eclipse Vert.x\n\nVert.x gives you a lot\
    \ of freedom in how you can shape your application and code. But it also provides\
    \ bricks to start writing reactive applications. Verticles are chunks of code\
    \ that get deployed and run by Vert.x. An application, such as a microservice,\
    \ would typically be comprised of many verticles. A verticle typically creates\
    \ servers or clients, registers a set of Handlers', and encapsulates a part of\
    \ the business logic of the system.\n\nIn Java, a verticle is a class extending\
    \ the Abstract Verticle class:\n\n```java\n    import io.vertx.core.AbstractVerticle;\n\
    \n    public class MyVerticle extends AbstractVerticle {\n        @Override\n\
    \        public void start() throws Exception {\n            // Executed when\
    \ the verticle is deployed\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void\
    \ stop() throws Exception {\n            // Executed when the verticle is un-deployed\n\
    \        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Creating a simple web server that can serve static\
    \ content\n\n**1. Compile and run the application Eclipse Vert.x application**\n\
    \nBefore we add code to create our web server you should build and test that current\
    \ application starts as it should.\n\nFirst, switch to the project directory:\n\
    \n```\ncd /root/projects/rhoar-getting-started/vertx/vertx-intro\n```\n\nSince\
    \ this is already a working application, you can run it without any code changes\
    \ locally directly using `maven` with goal `vertx:run`\n\n```\nmvn compile vertx:run\n\
    ```\n\n>**NOTE:** The vert.x maven plugin replays the phases executed before it\
    \ starts the application and it's therefor good practice to also specify the goals.\
    \  \n\nAt this stage, the application doesn't do anything, but after a while,\
    \ you should see the following two lines in your console window:\n\n```console\n\
    [INFO] Starting vert.x application...\n[INFO] THE HTTP APPLICATION HAS STARTED\n\
    ```\n>**NOTE:** The `\"Starting vert.x application...\"` line indicates that your\
    \ application is starting and that the Verticles are triggered asynchronously.\
    \ The message `\"THE HTTP APPLICATION HAS STARTED\"` that comes from a `System.out.println`\
    \ in `HttpApplication.java` Verticle.\n\n**2. Add a router that can serve static\
    \ content**\n\nYour first job will be to add an `HTTP` server that can return\
    \ HTML pages.\n\n> **NOTE:** For your convenience the `HttpApplication` already\
    \ has the necessary import statements.\n\nFirst, you need to create a `Router`\
    \ object. This router will handle all incoming requests. Add the following line\
    \ in the `start` method `HttpApplication.java` where the matching `TODO` statement\
    \ is (or click the handy button that will insert the code in the correct place)\n\
    \n<pre class=\"file\" data-filename=\"src/main/java/com/example/HttpApplication.java\"\
    \ data-target=\"insert\" data-marker=\"// TODO: Create a router object\">Router\
    \ router = Router.router(vertx);</pre>\n\nWe also need to tell the router to map\
    \ incoming requests to files in the default location (e.g. `src/main/resources/webroot`).\
    \ You can do that by adding the following line to the matching `TODO` statement.\n\
    \n<pre class=\"file\" data-filename=\"src/main/java/com/example/HttpApplication.java\"\
    \ data-target=\"insert\" data-marker=\"// TODO: Add a StaticHandler for accepting\
    \ incoming requests\">router.get(\"/*\").handler(StaticHandler.create());</pre>\n\
    \nNow we are ready to start the HTTP server,\n<pre class=\"file\" data-filename=\"\
    src/main/java/com/example/HttpApplication.java\" data-target=\"insert\" data-marker=\"\
    // TODO: Create the HTTP server listening on port 8080\">vertx.createHttpServer().requestHandler(router).listen(8080);</pre>\n\
    \nNOTE: As you may have noticed Vert.x will automatically detect when you change\
    \ and files an immediately redeploy the changes. The automatic redeploy is very\
    \ convenient for development purposes but can be turned off for production usage.\n\
    \n**3. Test the application**\n\nTo begin, click on the **Local Web Browser**\
    \ tab in the console frame of this browser window, which will open another tab\
    \ or window of your browser pointing to port 8080 on your client.\n\n![Local Web\
    \ Browser Tab](/openshift/assets/middleware/rhoar-getting-started-vertx/web-browser-tab.png)\n\
    \nYou should now see an HTML page that looks like this:\n\n![Local Web Browser\
    \ Tab](/openshift/assets/middleware/rhoar-getting-started-vertx/web-page.png)\n\
    \nor use [this](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/)\
    \ link.\n\n> **NOTE:** The Invoke button doesn't work yet, but we will fix that\
    \ in the next step.\n\n## Congratulations\n\nYou have now successfully executed\
    \ the first step in this scenario.\n\nNow you've seen how you with basically three\
    \ lines of code can create an HTTP Server that is capable of serving static content\
    \ using the Vert.x Toolkit.\n\nIn next step of this scenario, we will add server-side\
    \ business logic to our application.\n"

- assignment: "# Expand your application with server side logic\n\nIn Step 1 you learned\
    \ how to start an HTTP Server and use a static handler to server static files\
    \ like HTML, CSS, etc. In this step, we will create a new handler that uses server-side\
    \ code.\n\nLooking closer at ``src/main/resources/webroot/index.html``{{open}}\
    \ we can see that there is a JavaScript function at the end that should react\
    \ if someone clicks the `Invoke` button. From this line `$.getJSON(\"/api/greeting?name=\"\
    ` we can see that the webpage expects an API call that will act as a greetings\
    \ function. The idea is that the API function should take the value of the input\
    \ field and turn it into a greeting string. \n\n**1. Add a method for handle greetings\
    \ call**\n\nFirst, we are going to implement a route handler called greeting.\
    \ You will implement it as a private method in the `HttpApplication` class that\
    \ takes a `RoutingContext` as a parameter. \n\nFirst open ``src/main/java/com/example/HttpApplication.java``{{open}}\
    \ again.\n\nFirst copy and paste the code below on the line stating `// TODO:\
    \ Add method for greeting here`.\n\n<pre class=\"file\" data-filename=\"src/main/java/com/example/HttpApplication.java\"\
    \ data-target=\"insert\" data-marker=\"// TODO: Add method for greeting here\"\
    >private void greeting(RoutingContext rc) {\n    String name = rc.request().getParam(\"\
    name\");\n    if (name == null) {\n        name = \"World\";\n    }\n\n    JsonObject\
    \ response = new JsonObject()\n        .put(\"content\", String.format(template,\
    \ name));\n\n    rc.response()\n        .putHeader(CONTENT_TYPE, \"application/json;\
    \ charset=utf-8\")\n        .end(response.encodePrettily());\n    }\n</pre>\n\n\
    The method uses a member variable called `template` that currently is defined\
    \ as ``static final String template = \"Hello, %s!\";``.\n\nNOTE: Since we want\
    \ our handler to return the response to the browser immediately we will use the\
    \ `rc.response().end()`. It is however possible to chain several handlers by using\
    \ `rc.response().write()` and `rc.next()`.  \n\n **2.Add a route**\n\nAfter implementing\
    \ the handler we now need to add a route matching `/api/greeting` like this:\n\
    \n<pre class=\"file\" data-filename=\"src/main/java/com/example/HttpApplication.java\"\
    \ data-target=\"insert\" data-marker=\"// TODO: Add router for /api/greeting here\"\
    >router.get(\"/api/greeting\").handler(this::greeting);</pre>\n\nNOTE: It's best\
    \ practice to add more specific routes before wildcard routes since Vert.x will\
    \ go through the routers in the same order they were added and if a matching route\
    \ is found and it calls `rc.end()` any subsequent routes will not be executed.\n\
    \n**3. Test the application**\n\nNow you should be able to use the **Invoke**\
    \ Button [here](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/).\
    \ Test by adding different values in the input and also test by changing the `template`\
    \ String in `HttpApplication.java`, to use another language. \n\n**4. Stop the\
    \ application**\n\nBefore moving on, click in the terminal window and then press\
    \ **CTRL-C** to stop the running application!\n\n## Congratulations\n\nYou have\
    \ now learned how to use multiple **Routes** and how to implement an HTTP Service\
    \ call that returns JSON. \n\nIn next step of this scenario we will deploy our\
    \ application to the OpenShift Container Platform."

    **Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform** is the preferred runtime for the **Red
    Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes** like **Vert.x**. OpenShift Container Platform
    is based on **Kubernetes** which is probably the most used Orchestration for containers
    running in production. **OpenShift** is currently the only container platform
    based on Kuberenetes that offers multitenancy. This means that developers can
    have their own personal, isolated projects to test and verify application before
    committing to a shared code repository.


    OpenShift also ships with a feature rich web console as well as command line tools
    to provide users with a friendly interface to work with applications deployed
    to the platform.


    **1. Login to OpenShift Container Platform**


    To login, we will use the `oc` command and then specify username and password
    like this:


    ```

    oc login [[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com -u
    developer -p developer --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true

    ```


    Congratulations, you are now authenticated to the OpenShift server.


    >**IMPORTANT:** If the above `oc login` command doesn''t seem to do anything,
    you may have forgotten to stop the application from the previous

    step. Click on the terminal and press **CTRL-C** to stop the application and try
    the above `oc login` command again!


    **2. Create project**


    [Projects](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html#projects)
    are a top-level concept to help you organize your deployments. An OpenShift project
    allows a community of users (or a user) to organize and manage their content in
    isolation from other communities. Each project has its own resources, policies
    (who can or cannot perform actions), and constraints (quotas and limits on resources,
    etc.). Projects act as a wrapper around all the application services and endpoints
    you (or your teams) are using for your work.


    For this scenario, let''s create a project that you will use to house your applications.


    ```

    oc new-project dev --display-name="Dev - Eclipse Vert.x Http App"

    ```


    **3. Open the OpenShift Web Console**


    OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to

    perform various tasks via a browser. To get a feel for how the web console

    works, click on the "OpenShift Console" tab next to the "Local Web Browser" tab.


    ![OpenShift Console Tab](/openshift/assets/middleware/rhoar-getting-started-vertx/openshift-console-tab.png)


    The first screen you will see is the authentication screen. Enter your username
    and password and

    then login:


    ![Web Console Login](/openshift/assets/middleware/rhoar-getting-started-vertx/login.png)


    After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a
    list of projects that your user has permission to view.


    ![Web Console Projects](/openshift/assets/middleware/rhoar-getting-started-vertx/projects.png)


    Click on your new project name to be taken to the project overview page which
    will list all of the routes, services, deployments, and pods that you have created
    as part of your project:


    ![Web Console Overview](/openshift/assets/middleware/rhoar-getting-started-vertx/overview.png)


    There''s nothing there now, but that''s about to change.

description: 'In this scenario, you will learn more about [Eclipse Vert.x](https://vertx.io),
  one of the runtimes included in [Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhoar).




  ## What you will learn

  You will learn how to get started with building a reactive web application that
  can serve static content as well as server-side business logic using Eclipse Vert.x.


  ## What is Eclipse Vert.x?


  ![Local Web Browser Tab](/openshift/assets/middleware/rhoar-getting-started-vertx/vertx-logo.png)


  Eclipse Vert.x is a reactive toolkit for the Java Virtual Machine that is polyglot
  (e.g., supports multiple programming languages).

  In this session, we will focus on Java, but it would be possible to build the same
  application in JavaScript, Groovy, Ruby, Ceylon, Scala, and Kotlin.


  Eclipse Vert.x is event-driven and non-blocking, which means that applications in
  Vert.x can handle a lot of concurrent requests using a small number of kernel threads.

  Vert.x lets your app scale with minimal hardware.


  Vert.x is incredibly flexible - whether it''s network utilities, sophisticated modern
  web applications, HTTP/REST microservices, high volume event processing or a full-blown
  back-end message-bus application, Vert.x is a great fit.


  Vert.x is used by many [different companies](http://vertx.io/whos_using/) from real-time
  gaming to banking and everything in between.


  Vert.x is not a restrictive framework or container and we don''t tell you a correct
  way to write an application. Instead, we give you a lot of useful bricks and let
  you create your app the way you want to.


  Vert.x is fun - Enjoy being a developer again. Unlike restrictive traditional application
  containers, Vert.x gives you incredible power and agility to create compelling,
  scalable, 21st-century applications the way you want to, with a minimum of fuss,
  in the language you want.


  * Vert.x is lightweight - Vert.x core is around 650kB in size.

  * Vert.x is fast. Here are some independent [numbers](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r8&hw=i7&test=plaintext).

  * Vert.x is not an application server. There''s no monolithic Vert.x instance into
  which you deploy applications. You just run your apps wherever you want to.

  * Vert.x is modular - when you need more bits just add the bits you need and nothing
  more.

  * Vert.x is simple but not simplistic. Vert.x allows you to create powerful apps,
  simply.

  * Vert.x is an ideal choice for creating light-weight, high-performance, microservices.
