title: Developing with odo
description: |
  ## Goal

  The goal of this lesson is to learn how to use the *OpenShift Do* (`odo`) command line tool to build and deploy applications on OpenShift.

  |What you need to know before you start|
  |----|
  |In order to get full benefit from taking this track you should...<br>• Be comfortable working at the command line in a terminal window.<br>• Have a general understanding about the purpose and use of [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform) as a management framework for Linux containers.<br>• Have an understanding of [Roles and RoleBindings](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/authentication/using-rbac.html) as they are used in Kubernetes and OpenShift|


  ## Concepts and techniques you'll cover

  * How the `odo` developer tool abstracts deployment tasks
  * Viewing OpenShift Projects and Applications
  * Using the OpenShift Web Console’s Developer Perspective
  * Working with multi-tiered applications with a web frontend
  * Invoking automatic OpenShift builds for iterative development

  ## When to use `odo`

  Odo is a developer-centric tool for building and running software on OpenShift. Odo streamlines common build and deployment tasks to let you focus on your application’s source code. You can use odo to reduce the cognitive load and rote steps that are typically involved when working on complex applications built using a mixed stack of component solutions.
