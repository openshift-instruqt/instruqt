title: Deploying Applications From Source
description: |
  ## Goal

  Learn how to deploy an application from its source code using a [Source-to-Image][s2i] build on OpenShift.

  ## Concepts

  * Linux containers and building container images
  * OpenShift Source-to-Image (S2I)
  * OpenShift Projects and Applications
  * OpenShift `oc` command line tool

  ## Use case

  You can have OpenShift build an application from source to deploy it, so you don't have to construct a container by hand with every change. OpenShift can then build and deploy new versions automatically when notified of souce code changes.

  This OpenShift cluster will self-destruct in one hour.

  title: Topic 1 - Creating an Initial Project
  assignment: |
    Before we get started, you need to login and create a project in OpenShift
    to work in.

    To login to the OpenShift cluster used for this course from the _Terminal_,
    run:

    ```
    oc login -u developer -p developer
    ```

    This will log you in using the credentials:

    * **Username:** ``developer``
    * **Password:** ``developer``

    You should see the output:

    ```
    Login successful.

    You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

        oc new-project <projectname>
    ```

    To create a new project called ``myproject`` run the command:

    ```
    oc new-project myproject
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    ```
    Now using project "myproject" on server "https://openshift:6443".

    You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

        oc new-app django-psql-example

    to build a new example application in Python. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

        kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node
    ```

    Switch to the _Console_ and login to the OpenShift web console using the
    same credentials you used above.

    ![Web Console Login](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/deploying-python-44/01-web-console-login.png)

    This should leave you at the list of projects you have access to. As we only
    created the one project, all you should see is ``myproject``.

    ![List of Projects](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/deploying-python-44/01-list-of-projects.png)

    Click on ``myproject`` and you should then be at the _Overview_ page for
    the project. Select the _Developer_ perspective for the project instead of the _Adminstrator_ perspective in the left hand side menu. If necessary click on the hamburger menu icon top left of the web console to expose the left hand side menu.

    ![Add to Project](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/deploying-images-44/01-add-to-project.png)


    As the project is currently empty, no workloads should be found and you will be presented with various options for how you can deploy an application.

    From the options presented for deploying an application, select _From Catalog_. This will land you on the _Developer Catalog_.

    ![Developer Catalog](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/deploying-python-44/02-developer-catalog.png)

    In this course you are going to deploy a web application which is implemented using the Python programming language.

    If no items are displayed when you view the _Developer Catalog_, uncheck _Operator Backed_ in the _Type_ filters on the left hand side. Click on _Languages_ on the left hand side and then select _Python_. Any options for deploying applications which are related to Python will be displayed.

    ![Available Python Versions](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/deploying-python-44/02-deploy-python-source.png)

    Click on the _Python_ tile for the generic Python Source-to-Image (S2I) builder. This will bring up a dialog with the details of the builder image. Click on _Create Application_ in the dialog.

    ![Create Python Application #1](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/deploying-python-44/02-create-python-application-1.png)

    Under the _Git_ settings, in the _Git Repo URL_ enter:

    `https://github.com/openshift-katacoda/blog-django-py`

    Scroll down to the _General_ settings and click on the _Application Name_ field.

    ![Create Python Application #2](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/deploying-python-44/02-create-python-application-2.png)

    When you click on the _Application Name_ field, the settings in this section should be pre-populated with values based on the Git repository name. Leave the settings with their default values.

    When you are ready, at the bottom of the page click on _Create_. This will create resources to manage the build and deployment of the application. You will then be redirected to the topology overview for the project.

    ![Application Topology View](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/deploying-python-44/02-application-topology-view.png)

    The topology overview provides a visual representation of the application you have deployed.

    The Git icon shown to the lower right of the ring can be clicked on to take you to the hosted Git repository from which the source code for the application was built.

    The icon shown to the lower left represents the build of the application. The icon will change from showing an hour glass, indicating the build is starting, to a sync icon indicating the build is in progress, and finally to a tick or cross depending on whether the build was successful or failed. Clicking on this icon will take you to the details of the current build.

    Once the application is running, the icon shown to the upper right can be clicked to open the URL for the application route which was created.

    The ring itself will progress from being white, indicating the deployment is pending, to light blue indicating the deployment is starting, and blue to indicate the application is running. The ring can also turn dark blue if the application is stopping.

    Clicking anywhere on the area enclosed by the ring will bring up a panel giving details of the resources for the application, and access to a general overview of the deployment.

    Once the build of the application image has completed, it will be deployed.

    Click on _Topology_ in the left hand menu bar to return to the topology view for the project.

    ![Topology View](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/deploying-python-44/04-application-topology-view.png)

    When you created the application using the web console, a _Route_ was automatically created for the application and it will be exposed outside of the cluster. The URL which can be used to access the application from a web browser was visible on the _Resources_ tab for the application you viewed previously.

    From the topology view, you can quickly get to the URL for the deployed application by clicking on the icon top right of the ring in the visualisation for the application.

    Wait for the ring to turn from light blue to blue to indicate the deployment is complete. Now click on the icon and you should see the blog application you deployed.

  title: Topic 5 - Deleting the Application
  assignment: |
    Instead of deploying the application from the web console, you can use the command line. Before we do that, lets delete the application we have already deployed.

    To do this from the web console you could visit each resource type created and delete them one at a time. The simpler way to delete an application is from the command line using the ``oc`` command line tool.

    To see a list of all the resources that have been created in the project so far, you can run the command:

    ```
    oc get all -o name
    ```

    This will display output similar to:

    ```
    pod/blog-django-py-1-build
    pod/blog-django-py-64fb76b5c9-6hzhn
    service/blog-django-py
    deployment.apps/blog-django-py
    replicaset.apps/blog-django-py-64fb76b5c9
    replicaset.apps/blog-django-py-6c7f488b57
    buildconfig.build.openshift.io/blog-django-py
    build.build.openshift.io/blog-django-py-1
    imagestream.image.openshift.io/blog-django-py
    route.route.openshift.io/blog-django-py
    ```

    You have only created one application, so you would know that all the resources listed will relate to it. When you have multiple applications deployed, you need to identify those which are specific to the application you may want to delete. You can do this by applying a command to a subset of resources using a label selector.

    To determine what labels may have been added to the resources, select one and display the details on it. To look at the _Route_ which was created, you can run the command:

    ```
    oc describe route/blog-django-py
    ```

    This should display output similar to:

    ```
    Name:                   blog-django-py
    Namespace:              myproject
    Created:                19 minutes ago
    Labels:                 app=blog-django-py
                            app.kubernetes.io/component=blog-django-py
                            app.kubernetes.io/instance=blog-django-py
                            app.kubernetes.io/name=python
                            app.kubernetes.io/part-of=blog-django-py-app
                            app.openshift.io/runtime=python
                            app.openshift.io/runtime-version=3.6
    Annotations:            openshift.io/host.generated=true
    Requested Host:         blog-django-py-myproject.2886795320-80-simba02.environments.katacoda.com
                              exposed on router default (host apps-crc.testing) 19 minutes ago
    Path:                   <none>
    TLS Termination:        <none>
    Insecure Policy:        <none>
    Endpoint Port:          8080-tcp

    Service:        blog-django-py
    Weight:         100 (100%)
    Endpoints:      10.128.0.65:8080
    ```

    In this case when deploying the application via the OpenShift web console, OpenShift has applied automatically to all resources the label ``app=blog-django-py``. You can confirm this by running the command:

    ```
    oc get all --selector app=blog-django-py -o name
    ```

    This should display the same list of resources as when ``oc get all -o name`` was run. To double check that this is doing what is being described, run instead:

    ```
    oc get all --selector app=blog -o name
    ```

    In this case, because there are no resources with the label ``app=blog``, the result will be empty.

    Having a way of selecting just the resources for the one application, you can now schedule them for deletion by running the command:

    ```
    oc delete all --selector app=blog-django-py
    ```

    To confirm that the resources have been deleted, run again the command:

    ```
    oc get all -o name
    ```

    If you do still see any resources listed, keep running this command until it shows they have all been deleted. You can find that resources may not be deleted immediately as you only scheduled them for deletion and how quickly they can be deleted will depend on how quickly the application can be shutdown.

    Although label selectors can be used to qualify what resources are to be queried, or deleted, do be aware that it may not always be the ``app`` label that you need to use. When an application is created from a template, the labels applied and their names are dictated by the template. As a result, a template may use a different labelling convention. Always use ``oc describe`` to verify what labels have been applied and use ``oc get all --selector`` to verify what resources are matched before deleting any resources.

  title: Topic 6 - Deploying Using the Command Line
  assignment: |
    You now have a clean project again, so lets deploy the same web application, but this time using the ``oc`` command line tool.

    The URL of the Git repository containing the web application is:

    `https://github.com/openshift-katacoda/blog-django-py`

    We want to deploy it using the S2I builder for the latest version of Python provided by the platform. To do this run the command:

    ```
    oc new-app python:latest~https://github.com/openshift-katacoda/blog-django-py
    ```

    This should display output similar to:

    ```
    --> Found image 2437334 (6 weeks old) in image stream "openshift/python" under tag "latest" for "python:latest"

        Python 3.6
        ----------
        ...

        Tags: builder, python, python36, python-36, rh-python36

        * A source build using source code from https://github.com/openshift-katacoda/blog-django-py will be created
          * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "blog-django-py:latest"
          * Use 'oc start-build' to trigger a new build
        * This image will be deployed in deployment config "blog-django-py"
        * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "blog-django-py"
          * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "blog-django-py"

    --> Creating resources ...
        imagestream.image.openshift.io "blog-django-py" created
        buildconfig.build.openshift.io "blog-django-py" created
        deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "blog-django-py" created
        service "blog-django-py" created
    --> Success
        Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/blog-django-py' to track its progress.
        Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
         'oc expose svc/blog-django-py'
        Run 'oc status' to view your app.
    ```

    OpenShift will assign a default name for the application created based on the name of the Git repository. In this case that is ``blog-django-py``. If you wanted to change the name, you could have supplied the ``--name`` option along with the name you wish to use as an argument.

    To monitor the log output from the build as it is running, run the command:

    ```
    oc logs bc/blog-django-py --follow
    ```

    This command will exit once the build has completed. You can also interrupt the command by typing _CTRL-C_ in the terminal window.

    To view the status of any applications deployed to the project you can run the command:

    ```
    oc status
    ```

    Once the build and deployment of the application has completed you should see output similar to:

    ```
    In project myproject on server https://openshift:6443

    svc/blog-django-py - 172.30.54.158:8080
      dc/blog-django-py deploys istag/blog-django-py:latest <-

        deployment #1 pending 10 seconds ago - 0/1 pods


    3 infos identified, use 'oc status --suggest' to see details.
    ```

    Unlike the case of deploying the application from the web console, the application is not exposed outside of the OpenShift cluster by default. To expose the application so it is available outside of the OpenShift cluster, you can run the command:

    ```
    oc expose service/blog-django-py
    ```

    Switch to the OpenShift web console by selecting on _Console_ to verify that the application has been deployed.

    You will note though that the visualisation on the topology view lacks icons for the build and source code repository. This is because they rely on special annotations and labels added to the deployment when creating an application from the web console. These annotations are not added automatically when creating the application from the command line. You can add the annotations later if you wanted.

    The icon for accessing the URL is still present on the visualisation. Alternatively, to view the hostname assigned to the route created from the command line, you can run the command:

    ```
    oc get route/blog-django-py
    ```

  title: Topic 7 - Triggering a New Build
  assignment: |
    The source code for an application isn't going to be static, so a way to trigger a new build after making any changes is required.

    To do this from the command line using ``oc``, run the command:

    ```
    oc start-build blog-django-py
    ```

    This should display:

    ```
    build.build.openshift.io/blog-django-py-2 started
    ```

    A new build could also have been triggered from the web console by finding the build configuration for the application under the _Builds_ menu, selecting the kebab menu on the right side of the entry, and clicking on _Start Build_.

    As before you can use ``oc logs`` to monitor the log output as the build runs. You can also monitor the progress of any builds in a project by running the command:

    ```
    oc get builds --watch
    ```

    As the build progresses, this should display output similar to:

    ```
    NAME                TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED         DURATION

    blog-django-py-2    Source    Git@fcdc38c   Complete   About a minute ago   1m9s
    ```

    To exit the command type _CTRL-C_ in the terminal window.

    To display information about the build configuration for the application you can run:

    ```
    oc describe bc/blog-django-py
    ```

    This will display output similar to:

    ```

    You can see details of the Git repository being used as the source for any build.

    You will also see listed webhook URLs that can be configured into a Git hosting service to trigger a new build automatically when changes are committed and pushed up to a Git repository. As you are using a Git repository on GitHub that you don't own this can not be done for this exercise, but if you had forked the Git repository into your own account, or this was your own application, it could have been configured.

    The typical workflow followed when developing an application, is to work on your application source code on your own local machine. When you are happy with changes and they are ready to be made live, commit the changes and push them up to the hosted Git repository linked to the build configuration. If a webhook has been configured, a new build and deployment would be triggered automatically, otherwise you can trigger a new build manually.

    In the case of where you are rapidly iterating on changes to test ideas and don't want to have to commit every change and push it back up to the hosted Git repository, you can use what is called a binary input build.

    To demonstrate this, clone the Git repository for the application by running:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/openshift-katacoda/blog-django-py
    ```

    This will create a sub directory ``blog-django-py`` containing the source code for the application:

    ```
    Cloning into 'blog-django-py'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    remote: Total 412 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 409
    Receiving objects: 100% (412/412), 68.49 KiB | 556.00 KiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (200/200), done.
    ```

    Change into the sub directory.

    ```
    cd blog-django-py
    ```

    To show how a build can be triggered from the local copy of the application source code, without needing to commit changes back to the Git repository, first run the command:

    ```
    echo 'BLOG_BANNER_COLOR=blue' >> .s2i/environment
    ```

    This command will update an environment variable setting file used by S2I to determine what environment variables are baked into the application image created.

    Start a new build by running the command:

    ```
    oc start-build blog-django-py --from-dir=. --wait
    ```

    This is similar to what you ran before, with the exception that the option ``--from-dir=.`` is also passed to the command, indicating that source code should be uploaded from the directory on the host where you are running the command, rather than it being pulled down from the hosted Git repository.

    The output from running the command should start with:

    ```
    Uploading directory "." as binary input for the build ...
    ```

    indicating that the source code is being uploaded.

    The ``--wait`` option is also supplied to indicate that the command should only return when the build has completed. This option can be useful if integrating it into a script and you need to ensure the build has completed before running a subsequent command.

    While the build command is running and the application is being deployed, switch to the web console to monitor progress. You can find the details for the current build by selecting _Builds_ from the left hand side menu, selecting on the build configuration for ``blog-django-py``, selecting the _Builds_ tab and then clicking on ``blog-django-py-3``.

    Once the build and deployment is finished, if you visit the web application once more, you will see that the banner colour has been changed to blue.

    When you use the ``--from-dir=.`` option with ``oc start-build``, the contents from the current working directory will only be used for that one build. If you wanted to run further builds with source code from your local directory, you would need to supply ``--from-dir=.`` each time.

    To return back to using the source code from the hosted Git repository, run:


    ```
    oc start-build blog-django-py
    ```

    This should output:

    ```
    build.build.openshift.io/blog-django-py-4 started
    ```

    If for some reason a build was wrongly started, or you realised it would fail anyway, you can cancel the build by running ``oc cancel-build`` and supplying the name of the build.

    ```
    oc cancel-build blog-django-py-4
    ```

    This should show the build has been cancelled.

    ```
    build.build.openshift.io/blog-django-py-4 marked for cancellation, waiting to be cancelled
    build.build.openshift.io/blog-django-py-4 cancelled
    ```

    You can confirm this by also looking at the list of all builds run.

    ```
    oc get builds
    ```

    This should display output similar to:

    ```
    NAME               TYPE     FROM             STATUS                       STARTED          DURATION

    blog-django-py-2   Source   Git@35b89e2      Complete                     8 minutes ago    1m28s
    blog-django-py-3   Source   Binary@35b89e2   Complete                     3 minutes ago    1m28s
    blog-django-py-4   Source   Git@35b89e2      Cancelled (CancelledBuild)   31 seconds ago   23s
    ```

    Note that starting a build using source code from a local directory on your own machine can only be done from the command line. There is no way to trigger such a build from the web console.
