  # Serverless Eventing Camel K

  This example demonstrates the idiomatic way of using [Camel K](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/index.html) in Knative for building event-driven applications. It leverages the Knative eventing broker as the central point that lets various services communicate via event pub/sub. It also shows how Camel K can be used for connecting the Knative event mesh with external systems, with integrations that can play the roles of "event source" or "event sink".

  ## What is Camel K?

  ### Your Integration Swiss-Army-Knife native on Kubernetes with Camel K

  Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes and is specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures.

  Camel K supports multiple languages for writing integrations. Based the Operator Pattern, Camel K performs operations on Kubernetes resources. Bringing integration to the next level. utilizing the benefit of the Apache Camel project, such as the wide variety of components and Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP).

  Camel K integrate seamlessly with Knative making it the best serverless technology for integration.

  ## Why Serverless?
  Deploying applications as Serverless services is becoming a popular architectural style.

  You will need a  platform that can run serverless workloads, while also enabling you to have complete control of the configuration, building, and deployment. Ideally, the platform also supports deploying the applications as linux containers.

  ##  OpenShift Serverless Eventing
  Knative Eventing on OpenShift Container Platform enables developers to use an event-driven architecture with serverless applications. An event-driven architecture is based on the concept of decoupled relationships between event producers that create events, and event sinks, or consumers, that receive them.

  Knative Eventing uses standard HTTP POST requests to send and receive events between event producers and consumers. These events conform to the CloudEvents specifications, which enables creating, parsing, sending, and receiving events in any programming language.

    In order to run Camel K, you will need access to an Kubernetes/OpenShift environment. Let's setup the fundamentals.

    ## Logging in to the Cluster via Dashboard

    Click the [Console](https://console-openshift-console-[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com) tab to open the dashboard.

    You will then able able to login with admin permissions with:

    * **Username:** ``admin``
    * **Password:** ``admin``

    ## Installing Camel K from the OpenShift OperatorHub
    Camel K Operator can be deployed on the OpenShift cluster from the OperatorHub. The OperatorHub is available from the OpenShift Container Platform web console and provides an interface for cluster administrators to discover and install Operators.

    It is responsible for building, deploying Camel Applications and also creating surrounding resources. It is also responsible for watching any code or configuration updates and automatically updates it. To install simply run the command.

    In the left navigation menu, click *Catalog* > *OperatorHub*
    In the Filter by keyword text box, enter Camel K to find the *Camel K Operator*.
    Read the information about the Operator, and click *Install*. This displays the Create Operator Subscription page.

    ![operatorhub](/openshift/assets/middleware/middleware-camelk/camel-k-eventing/Eventing-Step1-01-operatorhub.png)

    Select the following subscription settings:
    - Update Channel > *Stable*
    - Installation Mode > *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*
    - Approval Strategy > Automatic

    ![installoperator](/openshift/assets/middleware/middleware-camelk/camel-k-eventing/Eventing-Step1-02-installoperator.png)

    Click Subscribe. This displays the Operators > Installed Operators page.

    Wait a few moments until the Status for the Camel K Operator displays Succeeded and the subscription is Up to Date.

    ![installed](/openshift/assets/middleware/middleware-camelk/camel-k-eventing/Eventing-Step1-03-installed.png)

    ## Logging in to the Cluster via CLI

    Before creating any applications, login as admin. This will be required if you want to log in to the web console and
    use it.

    To login to the OpenShift cluster from the _Terminal_ run:

    ```
    oc login -u admin -p admin
    ```

    This will log you in using the credentials:

    * **Username:** ``admin``
    * **Password:** ``admin``

    Use the same credentials to log into the web console.

    ## Setup Knative Eventing


    OpenShift Serverless Eventing is designed to address a common need for cloud native development and provides composable primitives to enable late-binding event sources and event consumers. OpenShift Serverless Operator is subscribed in the cluster already.Let's go ahead and setup Knative Eventing to set the ground for the event mesh.

    Creating the knative-eventing namespace:

    ```
    oc new-project knative-eventing
    ```


    Let's go ahead setup KnativeEventing in the namespace

    ```
    oc apply -f serverless/eventing.yaml -n knative-eventing
    ```

    Once Knative Eventing complete it's setup. You will see all the pod in *Running status*, it means it is successfully installed.

    ```
    oc get pod -w
    ```

    ```

    ## Auto Bitcoin Trading System

    The example shows a simplified trading application that analyzes price variations of Bitcoins (BTC / USDT), and automate trading base on the predicted returns. In order to keep the system flexible with pluggable prediction logics, we are going to break the system into three separate parts.
    - *Source* - Load realtime Bitcoins values.
    - *Predictors* - Pluggable predictors with various strategy.
    - *Seller Alert* - Seller alert (Mainly to display the result).

    Assume the market only open for couple of hours, serverless application can optimize resource usage.
    In between these separate serverless services, events are pass through an *event mesh*.

    ![overview](/openshift/assets/middleware/middleware-camelk/camel-k-eventing/Eventing-Step2-00-overview.png)


    #### Enabling the Knative Eventing Broker

    The central piece of the event mesh that we're going to create is the Knative Eventing broker. It is a publish/subscribe entity that Camel K integrations will use to publish events or subscribe to it in order to being triggered when events of specific types are available. Subscribers of the eventing broker are Knative serving services, that can scale down to zero when no events are available for them.



    Create a new OpenShift project ``camel-knative``:
    ```
    oc new-project camel-knative
    ```


    To enable the eventing broker, we create a default broker in the current namespace using namespace labeling:
    ```
    oc label namespace camel-knative knative-eventing-injection=enabled
    ```

    Let go ahead create predictors for market and load the market events

    #### Run a prediction algorithms

    The market data feed available in the mesh can be now used to create different prediction algorithms that can publish events when they believe it's the right time to sell or buy bitcoins, depending on the trend of the exchange.

    We're going to run the same (basic) algorithm with different parameters, obtaining two predictors. The algorithm is basic and it's just computing if the BTC variation respect to the last observed value is higher than a threshold (expressed in percentage). The algorithm is bound to the event mesh via the Predictor.java integration file.

    In real life, algorithms can be also much more complicated. For example, Camel K can be used to bridge an external machine learning as-a-service system that will compute much more accurate predictions. Algorithms can also be developed with other ad hoc tools and plugged directly inside the Knative mesh using the Knative APIs.


    #### Create the first prediction algorithms

    Go to the text editor on the right, under the folder /root/camel-eventing. Right click on the directory and choose New -> File and name it `Predictor.java`.
    Paste the following code into the application.

    <pre class="file" data-filename="Predictor.java" data-target="replace">

    // camel-k: language=java
    import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

    import java.util.HashMap;
    import java.util.Map;

    import org.apache.camel.BindToRegistry;
    import org.apache.camel.PropertyInject;
    import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

    public class Predictor extends RouteBuilder {

      @Override
      public void configure() throws Exception {

          from("knative:event/market.btc.usdt")
            .unmarshal().json()
            .transform().simple("${body[last]}")
            .log("Latest value for BTC/USDT is: ${body}")
            .to("seda:evaluate?waitForTaskToComplete=Never")
            .setBody().constant("");

          from("seda:evaluate")
            .bean("algorithm")
            .choice()
              .when(body().isNotNull())
                .log("Predicted action: ${body}")
                .to("direct:publish");

          from("direct:publish")
            .marshal().json()
            .removeHeaders("*")
            .setHeader("CE-Type", constant("predictor.{{predictor.name}}"))
            .to("knative:event");

      }

      @BindToRegistry("algorithm")
      public static class SimpleAlgorithm {

        @PropertyInject(value="algorithm.sensitivity", defaultValue = "0.0001")
        private double sensitivity;

        private Double previous;

        public Map<String, Object> predict(double value) {
          Double reference = previous;
          this.previous = value;

          if (reference != null && value < reference * (1 - sensitivity)) {
            Map<String, Object> res = new HashMap<>();
            res.put("value", value);
            res.put("operation", "buy");
            return res;
          } else if (reference != null && value > reference * (1 + sensitivity)) {
            Map<String, Object> res = new HashMap<>();
            res.put("value", value);
            res.put("operation", "sell");
            return res;
          }
          return null;
        }
      }
    }

    </pre>

    Run the following command to start the first predictor:

    ```
    kamel run --name simple-predictor -p predictor.name=simple camel-eventing/Predictor.java -t knative-service.max-scale=1 --logs
    ```

    The command above will deploy the integration and wait for it to run, then it will show the logs in the console.

    You will see the following log if everything is working correctly.

    #### Create the second prediction algorithms

    The second predictor with more sensitivity called better-predictor, in the command line run:

    ```
    kamel run --name better-predictor -p predictor.name=better -p algorithm.sensitivity=0.0005 camel-eventing/Predictor.java -t knative-service.max-scale=1
    ```

    You will be prompted with the following result, but please give a couple of minutes for the route to be deployed.
    ``integration "better-predictor" created``

    You can view both predictors from the [Developer Console Topology](https://console-openshift-console-[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/topology/ns/camel-knative/graph).

    #### Loading the Bitcoin live data
    Now, let's go ahead and start taking live data from the Bitcoin market and pushing it to the event mesh.
    Go to the text editor on the right, under the folder /root/camel-eventing. Right click on the directory and choose New -> File and name it `market-source.yaml`.
    Create the camel route loads Bitcoin market data every 10 seconds.

    Paste the following code into the application.

    <pre class="file" data-filename="market-source.yaml" data-target="replace">
    - from:
        uri: "timer:tick"
        parameters:
          period: 10000
        steps:
          - to: "xchange:binance?currencyPair=BTC/USDT&service=marketdata&method=ticker"
          - marshal:
              json: {}
          - log:
              message: "Sending BTC/USDT data to the broker: ${body}"
          - set-header:
              constant: market.btc.usdt
              name: CE-Type
          - to: "knative:event"
    </pre>

    Start the Camel K application

    ```
    kamel run camel-eventing/market-source.yaml -d camel-jackson
    ```

    The integration will be deployed on the cluster.

    After successfully deployed, you will be able to see it in the [Developer Console Topology](https://console-openshift-console-[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/topology/ns/camel-knative/graph).

    When the Bitcoin data start floating into the data, all predictor services and the investor service will automatically start up.

    ## When the market closes...

    Bitcoin market never closes, but closing hours are expected to be present for standard markets. We're going to simulate a closing on the market by stopping the source integration.

    When the market closes and updates are no longer pushed into the event mesh, all downstream services will scale down to zero. This includes the two prediction algorithms, the two services that receive events from the mesh and also the external investor service.

    To simulate a market close, we will delete the market-source:

    ```
    kamel delete market-source
    ```

    To see the other services going down, go to the [Developer Console Topology view](https://console-openshift-console-[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/topology/ns/camel-knative/graph) after two minutes, you will see the pod slowly shutdown.

    ![marketclose](/openshift/assets/middleware/middleware-camelk/camel-k-eventing/Eventing-Step4-01-marketclose.png)

    ## Congratulations

    In this scenario you got to play with Camel K and Serverless - Knative Eventing. We use Camel K as a Source to load data into event mesh based on Broker. And create couple of functions using Camel K that subscribe to the events in the mesh. There are much more to Camel K. Be sure to visit [Camel K](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/index.html) to learn even more about the architecture and capabilities of this exciting new framework.
