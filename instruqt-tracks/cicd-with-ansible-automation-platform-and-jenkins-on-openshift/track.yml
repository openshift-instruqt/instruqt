description: |
  ## Goal

  The goal of this track is to learn CI/CD with the Ansible Automation Platform and Jenkins on OpenShift.

  |What you need to know before you start|
  |----|
  |In order to get full benefit from taking this track you should...<br>• Be comfortable working at the command line in a terminal window.<br>• Have a general understanding about the purpose and use of [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform)|

  ## What's CI/CD?
  A subset of application deployment, continuous deployment pipelines help developers release new software features and update more frequently to support modern business demands. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform provides the multi-tier, multi-step application orchestration needed for fast, reliable deployment of new features, bug fixes, and code changes while reducing the need for human intervention throughout the release process.
