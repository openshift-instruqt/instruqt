description: |-
  ## Goal

  The goal of this track is to get you started with OpenShift Pipelines to automate the deployment of your applications.


  |What you need to know before you start|
  |----|
  |In order to get full benefit from taking this track you should...<br>• Be comfortable working at the command line in a terminal window.<br>• Have a general understanding about the purpose and use of [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform)|

  ## Concepts and techniques you'll cover

  * Install the OpenShift Pipelines Operator
  * Create a Hello World `Task`
  * Install task resource definitions
  * Create a Tekton `Pipeline`
  * Trigger the created pipeline to finish your application deployment.

  ## OpenShift Pipelines

  OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
  solution for building pipelines using [Tekton](https://tekton.dev). Tekton is
  a flexible, Kubernetes-native, open-source CI/CD framework that enables automating
  deployments across multiple platforms (e.g. Kubernetes, serverless, VMs, and so forth) by
  abstracting away the underlying details.
