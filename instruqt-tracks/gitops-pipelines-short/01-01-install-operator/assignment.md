‚ùì What's OpenShift Pipelines?
===============================

[OpenShift Pipelines](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cicd/pipelines/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html) are an OpenShift add-on that can be installed via an operator that is available in the OpenShift OperatorHub. It allows for cloud-native, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) solution for building pipelines using [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/).

Let's install the operator using the OpenShift Pipelines Operator in the OpenShift Web Console!
