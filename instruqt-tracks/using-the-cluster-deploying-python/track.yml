title: Deploying Applications From Source
description: |
  ## Goal

  The goal of this track is to learn how to deploy an application from its source code using either the OpenShift Web Console or by using OpenShift from a command line in a terminal window.

  |What you need to know before you start|
  |----|
  |In order to get full benefit from taking this track you should...<br>• Be comfortable working at the command line in a terminal window.<br>• Have a general understanding about the purpose and use of [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform) as a management framework for Linux containers.|

  ## Concepts and techniques you'll cover

  * How to create an application with OpenShift using source code from a GitHub source code repository
  * How to create an application using the OpenShift Web Console
  * How to create an application in an automated manner using OpenShift from the command line
  * Understanding the various aspects of working with an application rendered in a project's Topology page in the OpenShift Web Console
  * How to determine an application's build status by viewing an application's logs from a project's Topology page
  * How to create and delete an application in OpenShift from a command line in a terminal window
  * How to start new application builds in OpenShift from a command line in a terminal window

  ## Use case

  You'll use the concepts and techniques presented in this track when you want to create and deploy applications from source code using OpenShift automation and thus avoid doing the work manually.
