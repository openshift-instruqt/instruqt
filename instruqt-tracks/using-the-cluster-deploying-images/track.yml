title: Deploying Applications From Images
description: |
  ## Goal

  The goal of this lesson is to learn how to deploy an application on OpenShift with the web console and with the `oc` command line tool.

  |What you need to know before you start|
  |----|
  |In order to get full benefit from taking this track, you should...<br>• Be comfortable working at the command line in a terminal window.<br>• Have a general understanding about the purpose and use of [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform) as a management framework for Linux containers.|

  ## Concepts and techniques you'll cover

  * How to deploy a container image to an OpenShift cluster
  * Understanding how to work with the OpenShift Web Console’s Topology view
  * Understanding how to scale up an application created from a container image
  * Using the OpenShift `oc` tools to  delete an existing application and create a new one

  ## When to use container image deployment

  You deploy a container image on an OpenShift cluster in order to make the application easier to manage, scale, connect and monitor.
