    ## Goal

    The goal of this lesson is to learn how to deploy an application on OpenShift with the web console and with the `oc` command line tool.

    ## Concepts and techniques you'll cover

    * How to deploy a container image to an OpenShift cluster
    * Understanding how to work with the OpenShift Web Consoleâ€™s Topology view
    * Understanding how to scale up an application created from a container image
    * Using the OpenShift `oc` tools to  delete an existing application and create a new one

    ## When to use container image deployment

    You deploy a container image on an OpenShift cluster in order to make the application easier to manage, scale, connect and monitor.

In this topic, you will learn how to log into an OpenShift cluster from the command line, and also by using the web console.

----

`Step 1:` Run the following command in the terminal window to the left to log into the OpenShift cluster as **Username:** `developer` with **Password:** `developer`:

```
oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
```

You will see the following output when your login is successful:

```
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
```

Once you are logged in, you will create a new project named, `myproject`.

----

`Step 2:` Run the following command to create a project named, `myproject`:

```
oc new-project myproject
```

You will see the following output upon success:

```
Now using project "myproject" on server "https://openshift:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app django-psql-example

to build a new example application in Python. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node
```

----

`Step 3:`  Switch to the OpenShift web console by clicking the **Web Console** tab, which is the second tab in the horizontal menu bar at the top of the terminal window to the left.

|NOTE:|
|----|
|You might see the following warning notification due to using an untrusted security certificate.

If you do get the warning, click the **Advanced** button to complete the process necessary to grant permission to the browser to access the OpenShift Web Console.|

----

`Step 4:`  Enter the **Username:** `developer` and **Password:** `developer` pair shown in the figure below.

![login dialog](../assets/web-console-login.png)

You will see the list of projects you have access to. Since you only created one project previously, you will see that project as shown in the figure below.

----

`Step 5:`  Click on `myproject`. You will be presented with the **Topology** page as shown in the figure below.

![Topology without resource](../assets/topology-no-resources.png)

Notice that the project has no resources.

# Congratulations!

You've just logged in to an OpenShift cluster using the command line as well as using the web console.
