  This lab will help give you a basic understanding of how to use some other OCI compliant tools such as Podman, Buildah, and Skopeo.

  By the end of this lab you should be able to:
  - FIND, RUN, BUILD, and SHARE containers using OCI compliant tools
  - Solve real technical problems by using a small set of daemonless tools
  - Be comfortable using with the basics of an alternative set of tools to Docker

  ## Outline
