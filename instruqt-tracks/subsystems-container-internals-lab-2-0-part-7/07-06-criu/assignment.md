With some help from a program called CRIU, Podman can checkpoint and restore containers on the same host. This can be useful with workloads that have a long startup period or require a long time to warm up caches. For example, large memcached servers, database, or even Java workloads can take several minutes or even hours to reach maximum throughput performance. This is often referred to as cache warming.

If this doesn't quite make sense, let's talk about it in the context of container creation and deletion. Podman allow you to break the creation and deletion of containers down into very granular steps. Here's what the life cycle of a container looks like from start to finish:

1. podman pull - Pull the container image
2. podman create - Add tracking meta-data to /var/lib/containers or .local/share/containers
3. podman mount - Create a copy-on-write layer and mount the container image with a read/write layer above it
4. podman init - Create a config.json file
5. podman start - Run the workload by handing the config.json and root file system to runc
6. Workload runs either as a batch process, or as a daemon
7. podman kill - kills the process or processes in the container
8. podman rm - Unmount and delete the copy-on-write layer
9. podman rmi - remove the image /var/lib/containers or .local/share/containers

To understand CRIU, you need to understand step 6. When this step is executed, Podman sends a kill signal to the processes in the container. CRIU allows us to break this down even further like this:


1. podman pull - Pull the container image
2. podman create - Add tracking meta-data to /var/lib/containers or .local/share/containers
3. podman mount - Create a copy-on-write layer and mount the container image with a read/write layer above it
4. podman init - Create a config.json file
5. podman start - Run the workload by handing the config.json and root file system to runc
6. Workload runs either as a batch process, or as a daemon
7. podman checkpoint - Dump contents of memory to disk and kill processes
8. Workload process no longer running, memory contents are saved on disk
9. podman restore - Restore memory contents to new processes
10. Workload runs either as a batch process, or as a daemon
11. podman kill - kills the process or processes in the container
12. podman rm - Unmount and delete the copy-on-write layer
13. podman rmi - remove the image /var/lib/containers or .local/share/containers

So, in a nutshell, CRIU gives you more flexibility with containerized processes. Let's see it in action. First, start a simple container which generates incrementing numbers so that we can verify memory contents are really restored:

```
podman run -d --name looper ubi8 /bin/sh -c \
         'i=0; while true; do echo $i; i=$(expr $i + 1); sleep 1; done'
```

Now, verify that numbers are being generated. Run this a few times to see the numbers incrementing:

```
podman logs -l
```

Now, let's dump the contents of memory to disk, and kill the process:

```
podman container checkpoint -l
```

Verify that it's not running. Notice that that container is in the exited state. This means the copy-on-write layer for the container has not been deleted. Since we used the checkpoint sub-command, the contents of memory are also saved on disk:

```
podman ps -a
```

Verify that numbers are not being generated. Run this a few times to verify:

```
podman logs -l
```

Restore the container:

```
podman container restore -l
```

Verify the contents of memory and disk are being used and the numbers are incrementing again:

```
podman logs -l
```

We're all done, so clean up. This will kill the process, delete the contents of the copy-on-write layer, and remove all of the meta-data for all containers:

```
podman kill -a
```

## Conclusions

Checkpointing and restoring containers is easy with CRIU and Podman. As part of the container-tools application streams, specific versions of Podman and CRIU are tested and verified to work together (not all versions of Podman and CRIU are guaranteed to work together). Now, let's move on to some more tools.
