    # Import the code

    Let's refresh the code we'll be using. Run the following command to clone the sample project in Terminal 1:

    ```
    cd /root/projects && rm -rf rhoar-getting-started && git clone https://github.com/openshift-katacoda/rhoar-getting-started && cd rhoar-getting-started/spring/spring-rest-services
    ```

    # Get project set up

    **1. Adding Spring MVC and Tomcat to the application**

    Since our application will be a web application, we need to use a servlet container like Apache Tomcat or Undertow to handle incoming connections from clients. Since Red Hat offers support for Apache Tomcat (e.g., security patches, bug fixes, etc.), we will use it here.

    In addition we are going to utilize the Spring MVC project which contains many of the abstractions we will use to build our APIs. Observe the following code block in the `pom.xml` in Visual Editor.

    ```xml
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    ```

    You may notice that there is no `<version>` tag here. That's because the version numbers are managed and automatically derived by the BOM mentioned in the previous trainings.

    **2. Test the application locally**

    Run the application by executing the following command in Terminal 1:

    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    You should eventually see a log line like `Started Application in 4.497 seconds (JVM running for 9.785)`. Open the application by clicking on the *Fruit App* Tab. Then stop the application by pressing **<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>**.

    ## Congratulations

    You have now successfully executed the first step in this scenario.

    # Create REST services for the fruit web application

    RESTful web services are one of the core use cases for the Spring Boot framework as Spring makes it very easy to create HTTP APIs serving a variety of data types. We'll be learning how to use the standard HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, how to use path segments, and how to return JSON content in this scenario.

    **1. Review the Model**

    We have already created the model for our Fruit objects due to it being necessary for the Repository. Click on the following link which will open the empty file in the editor: `src/main/java/com/example/service/Fruit.java`. As you can see it is just a Plain-Old-Java-Object (POJO) with some JPA-specific annotations. Don't worry about the annotations. They are not important for this module.

    **2. Add a Controller**

    Next we need to create a Spring Controller to handle HTTP requests to our application. The `@RestController` annotation on a Java class marks the class as a Controller (intended to be of the REST variety) which Spring will register automatically for you on application start.

    First, we need to create the java class file. From the *Visual Editor* Tab, create this file: `src/main/java/com/example/service/FruitController.java`.

    ![File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/rhoar-getting-started-spring/create-file-fc-sb.png)

    Open the `FruitController.java` file then copy the below content into the file:

    ```java
    package com.example.service;

    import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

    import java.util.List;

    @RestController
    @RequestMapping("/api/fruits")
    public class FruitController {

        @Autowired FruitRepository repository; // Ignore this

        // TODO GET mappings
        // TODO POST mapping
        // TODO PUT mapping
        // TODO DELETE mapping

    }
    ```

    The `@RestController` annotation tells Spring that this is a special kind of Controller meant to be returning data (not views) when called. If we used the standard Spring `@Controller` annotation instead we would have to also annotate the `getAll()` method (and any other API methods for that matter) with the `@ResponseBody` annotation. `@RestController` implies the `@ResponseBody` annotation for us so we don't have to type it every time!

    `@RequestMapping` is our way to tell Spring which URIs this Controller services. In this case we say we service the `/api/fruits` URI. Spring will thus route HTTP requests to that URI to this Controller.

    Click on the `Disk` icon to save the files or press `CTRL-S`:

    ![Visual Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/rhoar-getting-started-spring/save-fc-file.png)

    **2. Add GET Mappings**

    At the moment our Controller doesn't actually do any work. We need to add some handler methods. Let's start with the two HTTP GET methods, one for fetching all fruits and one for fetching a specific fruit.

    From *Visual Editor* Tab, copy the following at the `<!-- // TODO GET mappings -->` line:

    ```java
          @GetMapping
          public List<Fruit> getAll() {
              return repository.findAll();
          }

          @GetMapping("/{id}")
          public Fruit getFruit(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
              return repository.findById(id).orElse(null);
          }
    ```

    Save the file.

    To mark a method as a handler for HTTP GET verbs we use the `@GetMapping` annotation. There are a couple arguments that can be passed as arguments to the annotation. The most common argument is a `path` String. Like `@RequestMapping` (which `@GetMapping` is a specialized form of), if we provide a `path` to the annotation it tells Spring that `HTTP GET` requests to that path are to be handled by that method. In the absence of a path String, however, it tries to fall back to the `current path context`. In this case it falls back to the path we specified in the `@RequestMapping` annotation at the class level. This means that the actual route for this method is `GET /api/fruits`.

    The second `@GetMapping` for finding a specific Fruit by ID also inherits the path specified by `@RequestMapping` (and all subsequent Mapping annotations in this class will as well). The second one, however, adds context to that path by specifying it's own path. In the second method the route is `GET /api/fruits/{id}` where `id` is a `Path Variable`. This means that whatever value is specified in the last segment will be captured as the variable `id` which we declare to be a Long. This method would therefore be servicing routes like `GET /api/fruits/1`.

    **3. Test the service from a web browser locally**

    Run the application by executing the below command in Terminal 1:

    ```
    cd /root/projects/rhoar-getting-started/spring/spring-rest-services
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    When the console reports that Spring is up and running access the app from the *Fruit App* Tab.

    You should see something like this:

    ```json
    [{"name":"Cherry"},{"name":"Apple"},{"name":"Banana"}]
    ```

    These values are seeded values we've added to the project for you. What is important to note is that Spring automatically serialized our Fruit models to JSON, created the appropriate HTTP header for clients, and returned that response to the client without any extra code from us!

    >**NOTE:** JSON is not the only Media Type supported in Spring Boot. JSON is simply the default chosen by the framework.

    You can also try adding a `/1` to the end of the browser URL. It should just return `{"name":"Cherry"}`.

    Press **<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>** to stop the application when you are done.

    **4. Add POST Mapping**

    Next let's add a handler for accepting HTTP POST requests to create new entries.

    From *Visual Editor* Tab, copy the following at the `// TODO POST mapping"` line:

    ```java
          @PostMapping
          public Fruit createFruit(@RequestBody Fruit fruit) {
              return repository.save(fruit);
          }
    ```

    Save the file.

    For a `@PostMapping` we are expecting a JSON Request Body to be sent to our application that follows the `Fruit` form. As a reminder from above, a Fruit in JSON form looks like `{"name":"Cherry"}`. This Request Body will be automatically deserialized from JSON to a Java Object by Spring if we have a POJO that matches. In this case we have our `Fruit` class. The `@RequestBody` annotation instructs Spring to try to deserialize the Request JSON into a `Fruit` object and inject it as an argument to our handler method. We can then do whatever we need to do with the Java Object (in this case - save it off). We have omitted input checking for brevity but always remember to sanitize your inputs in real applications!

    Run the application again by executing the command:

    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    This time we will use the included web application into the *Fruit App* Tab to POST new Fruits to the application. Add a Fruit name into the `Add a Fruit` text box and click the `Save` button. If all is well it should show up in the right-hand `Fruits List` view.

    Press **<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>** to stop the application.

    **5. Add PUT Mapping**

    Next let's add a handler for accepting HTTP PUT requests to update existing entries.

    From *Visual Editor* Tab, copy the following at the `// TODO PUT mapping` line:


    ```java
          @PutMapping("/{id}")
          public Fruit updateFruit(@PathVariable("id") Long id, @RequestBody Fruit fruit) {
              fruit.setId(id);
              return repository.save(fruit);
          }
    ```

    Save the file.

    Just like the `@GetMapping` above this PUT handler handles requests to a path segment of the `/api/fruits` URI. In this case it handles routes like `PUT /api/fruits/1`. The route defines the ID being updated and the `@RequestBody`, just like in the POST mapping, contains the JSON payload for the Fruit change.

    Run the application again by executing the command:

    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    Again we will use the included web application in the *Fruit App* Tab to edit existing Fruits with a HTTP PUT to the application. Click the `Edit` button on one of the Fruits. It's name will populate the `Add a Fruit` text box. Change it to something else and click the `Save` button. If all is well it should show up in the right-hand `Fruits List` view with the new name.

    Press **<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>** to stop the application.

    **6. Add DELETE Mapping**

    Finally, let's add a handler for accepting HTTP DELETE requests to delete existing entries.

    From *Visual Editor* Tab, copy the following at the `// TODO DELETE mapping` line:

    ```java
          @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
          public void delete(@PathVariable("id") Long id) {
              repository.deleteById(id);
          }
    ```

    Save the file.

    We are again utilizing a route segment to specify an ID in the route. Thus this handler will handle routes like `DELETE /api/fruits/1`.

    Run the application once more by executing the

    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    This time we will use the included web application from the *Fruit App* Tab to DELETE Fruits from the application. Click the `Remove` button next to any of the Fruit entries. If all is well it should remove that Fruit from the List.

    >**NOTE**: Do not blindly accept IDs like this in your path for deletion in production applications! Make sure there is some level of security to ensure this functionality cannot be abused.

    Press **<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>** to stop the application.

    # Login and Deploy to OpenShift Container Platform

    **Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform** is the preferred runtime for **Red Hat Runtimes** like **Spring Boot**, **Vert.x**, etc. The OpenShift Container Platform is based on **Kubernetes** which is a Container Orchestrator that has grown in popularity and adoption over the last years. **OpenShift** is currently the only container platform based on Kubernetes that offers multitenancy. This means that developers can have their own personal, isolated projects to test and verify applications before committing to a shared code repository.

    OpenShift also ships with a feature rich web console as well as command line tools to provide users with a friendly interface to work with applications deployed to the platform.

    **1. Login to the OpenShift Container Platform**

    Run the following command to login with the OpenShift CLI:

    ```
    oc login -u admin -p admin
    ```

    You should see:

    ```bash
    Login successful.
    You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running `oc new-project <projectname>`
    ```

    Then you'll create the project:

    ```
    oc new-project dev --display-name="Dev - Spring Boot App"
    ```

    Now create a database:

    ```
    oc new-app -e POSTGRESQL_USER=dev \
              -e POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=secret \
              -e POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=my_data \
              openshift/postgresql:12-el8 \
              --name=my-database
    ```

    Our application knows how to interact with the database because you defined the properties in the `src/main/resources/application-openshift.properties` file. You can see below that the URL, username, password, and driver for the database have been supplied.

    ```text
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://${MY_DATABASE_SERVICE_HOST}:${MY_DATABASE_SERVICE_PORT}/my_data
    spring.datasource.username=${DB_USERNAME}
    spring.datasource.password=${DB_PASSWORD}
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
    ```

    Save the file.

    Run the following command to deploy the application to OpenShift in Terminal 1:

    ```
    mvn package oc:deploy -Popenshift -DskipTests -f /root/projects/rhoar-getting-started/spring/spring-rest-services
    ```

    This step may take some time to do the Maven build and the OpenShift deployment. After the build completes you can verify that everything is started by running the following command:

    ```
    oc rollout status dc/spring-rest-services
    ```

    After the rollout is complete you can go to the OpenShift web console, login with **admin**/**admin** credentials, select **dev** project and find the route to your application under **Routes**.

    Access the OpenShift Web Console to login from the Web UI:

    ```
    oc get routes console -n openshift-console -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
    ```

    Copy the URL from the output of the above command or click to it to open it in your browser.

    We'll deploy our app as the `admin` user. Use the following credentials:

    * Username:
    ```
    admin
    ```

    * Password:
    ```
    admin

    ![Route from Web Console](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/middleware/rhoar-spring-rest-services/route.png)

    Run this command to get the app's Route:

    ```
    oc get route spring-rest-services -n dev -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}{"/api/fruits"}{"\n"}'

    ```

    You should see the same JSON output as the previous step:

    ```json
    [{"name":"Cherry"},{"name":"Apple"},{"name":"Banana"}]
    ```

    And if you open the web application, the same functionality from the previous steps should still work.
