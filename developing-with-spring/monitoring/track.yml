    # Import the code

    Let's refresh the code we'll be using. Run the following command to clone the sample project in Terminal 1:

    ```
    cd /root/projects && rm -rf rhoar-getting-started && git clone https://github.com/openshift-katacoda/rhoar-getting-started && cd rhoar-getting-started/spring/spring-monitoring
    ```

    # Review the base structure of the application

    For your convenience, this scenario has been created with a base project using the Java programming language and the Apache Maven build tool.

    As you review the content, you will notice that there are a couple **TODO** comments. **Do not remove them!** These comments are used as markers for later exercises in this scenario.  From the *Visual Editor* Tab, open: this file `src/main/java/com/example/service/FruitController.java`. This is our rest controller. We will be adding our logging commands here later in this module.

    **1. Test the application locally**

    As we develop the application we want to be able to test and verify our change at different stages. One way we can do that locally is by using the `spring-boot` maven plugin.

    Run the application by executing the following command in Terminal 1:

    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    Once that's completed, open the *Fruit App* Tab to access the app.

    You should now see an HTML page with a `Success` welcome message that looks like this:

    ![Success](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/rhoar-monitoring/landingPage.png)

    If you see this then you've successfully set up the application! If not check the logs in the terminal. Spring Boot adds a couple helper layers to catch common errors and print helpful messages to the console so check for those first.

    **2. Stop the application**

    Before moving on, click in the terminal window and then press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the running application!

    ## Congratulations

    You have now successfully executed the first step in this scenario. In the next step we will login to OpenShift and create a new project.

    # Deploy to OpenShift Application Platform
    **1. Deploying the application to OpenShift**

    Run the following command to login with the OpenShift CLI in Terminal 1:

    ```
    oc login -u admin -p admin
    ```

    You should see:

    ```bash
    Login successful.
    You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running `oc new-project <projectname>`
    ```

    Let's create a project that you will use to house your applications.

    ```
    oc new-project dev --display-name="Dev - Spring Boot App"
    ```

    Run the following command to deploy the application to OpenShift in Terminal 1:

    ```
    mvn package oc:deploy -Popenshift -DskipTests -f /root/projects/rhoar-getting-started/spring/spring-monitoring
    ```

    This step may take some time to do the Maven build and the OpenShift deployment. After the build completes you can verify that everything is started by running the following command:

    ```
    oc rollout status dc/spring-monitoring
    ```

    **2. Using a Route to reach the application from the internet**

    Now that our application is deployed to OpenShift, how do external users access it? The answer is with a **Route**. By using a route, we are able to expose our services and allow for external connections at a given hostname.

    Access the OpenShift Web Console to login from the Web UI and access the `dev` project:

    ```
    oc get routes console -n openshift-console -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
    ```

    Copy the URL from the output of the above command or click to it to open it in your browser.

    We'll deploy our app as the `developer` user. Use the following credentials:

    * Username:
    ```
    admin
    ```

    * Password:
    ```
    admin
    ```

    Switch to `Developer Perspective` then click on `Topology` view in `Dev` project.
    ![Routes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/rhoar-monitoring/routes.png)

    Access the application endpoint by adding `/fruits` to the route URL that you click on `Open UR` link.

    We should now see the same `Success` page that we saw when we first tested our app locally:

    ![Success](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/rhoar-monitoring/landingPage.png)

    ## Congratulations

    You have now learned how to access the application via an external route. In our next step, we will navigate through OpenShift's web console in order to view our application and learn about health checks.

    # Implementing Health Checks

    Now that our project has been deployed to OpenShift and we've verified that we're able to hit our endpoint, it's time to add a health check to the application.

    **1. View Health Checks**

    Our application is now up and running on OpenShift and accessible to all users. However how do we handle an application failure? Without constantly manually veriifying the application there would be no way to know when the application crashes. Luckily OpenShift can handle this issue by using probes.

    There are two types of probes that we can create; a `liveness probe` and a `readiness probe`. Liveness probes are used to check if the container is still running. Readiness probes are used to determine if containers are ready to service requests. We're going to be creating a health check, which is a liveness probe that we'll use to keep track of our application health.

    Our health check will continually poll the application to ensure that the application is up and healthy. If the check fails, OpenShift will be alerted and will restart the container and spin up a brand new instance. You can read more about the specifics [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/applications/application-health.html).

    Since a lack of health checks can cause container issues if they crash, OpenShift will alert you with a warning message if your project is lacking one.

    In _Topology_ view, select your deployment. You should see something like this:

    ![Missing Health Checks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/rhoar-monitoring/healthChecks.png)

    Since we have a Spring Boot application we have an easy option for implementation of health checks. We're able to pull in the `Spring Actuator` library.

    **2. Add Health Checks with Actuator**

    Spring Actuator is a project which exposes health data under the API path `/actuator/health` that is collected during application runtime automatically. All we need to do to enable this feature is to add the following dependency to ``pom.xml`` at the **TODO** comment.

    ```xml
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    ```

    Click on the `Disk` icon to save the files or press `CTRL-S`:

    ![Visual Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/rhoar-monitoring/save-pom-file.png)

    Notice how the previous warning message from before regarding missing health checks is no longer present. This is because of the dependency that we just added to ourt `pom.xml`. Adding this dependency triggers jkube to create Readiness/Liveness probes for OpenShift. These probes will periodically query the new health endpoints to make sure the app is still up.

    Run the following command again to re-deploy the application to OpenShift:

    ```
    mvn package oc:deploy -Popenshift -DskipTests -f /root/projects/rhoar-getting-started/spring/spring-monitoring
    ```

    Now that we've added Spring Actuator, we're able to hit their provided `/actuator/health` endpoint. We can navigate to it by either adding `/actuator/health` to our landing page, or by clicking on the Route below.


    Run this command to get the app's Route:

    ```
    oc get route spring-monitoring -n dev -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}{"/actuator/health"}{"\n"}'

    ```

    We should now see the following response, confirming that our application is up and running properly:

    ```json
    {"status":"UP","groups":["liveness","readiness"]}
    ```

    OpenShift will now continuously poll this endpoint to determine if any action is required to maintain the health of our container.

    **3.Other Spring Actuator endpoints for monitoring**

    The `/actuator/health` endpoint isn't the only endpoint that Spring Actuator provides out of the box. We're going to take a closer look at a few of the different endpoints so we can see how they help us with monitoring our newly deployed application, specifically the `/metrics` and `/beans` endpoints. A list of all other Spring Actuator endpoints can be found [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html).

    Unlike the `/actuator/health` endpoint some of these endpoints can return sensitive information and require authentication. For simplicity purposes we will be removing this security requirement in order to hit the endpoints, but this is not recommended for a production environment with sensitive data. From the *Visual Editor* Tab, open up the application.properties file `src/main/resources/application.properties` and add this code to disable endpoint security after the `# TODO: Add Security preference here` line:

    ```text
    management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
    ```

    Save the file.

    If we redeploy the application again with:

    ```
    mvn package oc:deploy -Popenshift -DskipTests -f /root/projects/rhoar-getting-started/spring/spring-monitoring
    ```

    Now we can hit the `/actuator/metrics` endpoint from the Web Console or from here:

    ```
    oc get route spring-monitoring -n dev -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}{"/actuator/metrics"}{"\n"}'

    ```

    This returns a list of metrics types accessible to us:

    ```json
    {"names":["http.server.requests","jvm.buffer.count","jvm.buffer.memory.used","jvm.buffer.total.capacity","jvm.classes.loaded","jvm.classes.unloaded","jvm.gc.live.data.size","jvm.gc.max.data.size","jvm.gc.memory.allocated","jvm.gc.memory.promoted","jvm.gc.pause","jvm.memory.committed","jvm.memory.max","jvm.memory.used","jvm.threads.daemon","jvm.threads.live","jvm.threads.peak","jvm.threads.states","logback.events","process.cpu.usage","process.files.max","process.files.open","process.start.time","process.uptime","system.cpu.count","system.cpu.usage","system.load.average.1m","tomcat.sessions.active.current","tomcat.sessions.active.max","tomcat.sessions.alive.max","tomcat.sessions.created","tomcat.sessions.expired","tomcat.sessions.rejected"]}
    ```

    We can then navigate to `/actuator/metrics/[metric-name]`. For example for JVM Memory Usage:

    ```
    oc get route spring-monitoring -n dev -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}{"/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max"}{"\n"}'
    ```

    This will display different types of metric data about the JVM Metrics:

    ```json
    {"name":"jvm.memory.max","description":"The maximum amount of memory in bytes that can be used for memory management","baseUnit":"bytes","measurements":[{"statistic":"VALUE","value":9.115271167E9}],"availableTags":[{"tag":"area","values":["heap","nonheap"]},{"tag":"id","values":["CodeHeap 'profiled nmethods'","PS Eden Space","CodeHeap 'non-profiled nmethods'","Compressed Class Space","PS Old Gen","PS Survivor Space","Metaspace","CodeHeap 'non-nmethods'"]}]}
    ```

    In addition to the different monitoring endpoints we also have informational endpoints like the `/actuator/beans` endpoint, which will show all of the configured beans in the application. Spring Actuator provides multiple informational endpoints on top of the monitoring endpoints that can prove useful for information gathering about your deployed Spring application and can be helpful while debugging your applications in OpenShift.
