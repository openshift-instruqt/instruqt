    # Import the code
    Let's refresh the code we'll be using. Run the following command to clone the sample project in Terminal 1:

    ```
    cd /root/projects && rm -rf rhoar-getting-started && git clone https://github.com/openshift-katacoda/rhoar-getting-started && cd rhoar-getting-started/spring/microservices-externalized-config
    ```

    # Review the base structure of the application
    **1. Understanding the Application**

    The project is a simple Greeting application, where a user inputs a fruit name and is greeted by our service. From the *Visual Editor* Tab, open the file in this path: `src/main/java/com/example/service/FruitController.java`. You can see the logic used to respond to our user. The interesting part of this logic is right here, where we retrieve the message:

    ```java
    String message = String.format(properties.getMessage(), name);
    ```

    If we take a closer look at this `properties` object, we see that it's of type `MessageProperties`. When we look at that file `src/main/java/com/example/service/MessageProperties.java` we see an annotation linking to a configuration prefix, `@ConfigurationProperties("greeting")`, which is pointing to our `src/main/resources/application-local.properties` file.

    Our `application-local.properties` file contains only one property, `greeting.message`. This is the message that we return and display to the user. In order to get an understanding of the flow, let's run the application locally. On the terminal build the project:

    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

    When the application finishes building, open the *Fruit App* Tab. You should see the same message that is in the `application-local.properties` file.

    Be sure to stop the application with `CTRL-C`.

    ## Congratulations

    You have now successfully executed the first step in this scenario. in the next step we're going to be deploying the project and testing it our for ourselves, as well as modifying this greeting through External Configuration.

    # Deploy to OpenShift Application Platform

    **1. Create a project**

    Run the following command to login with the OpenShift CLI in Terminal 1:

    ```
    oc login -u admin -p admin
    ```

    You should see:

    ```bash
    Login successful.
    You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running `oc new-project <projectname>`
    ```

    Let's first create a new project:

    ```
    oc new-project dev --display-name="Dev - Spring Boot App"
    ```

    **2. Additional Configuration**

    Before we deploy the application, we have to make a few changes so our application runs smoothly using External Configurations.

    The first step is we're going to assign view access rights to the service account we're logged in as. We have to do this before deploying the application so that it's able to access the OpenShift API and read the contents of the `ConfigMap`. We can do that with the following command:

    ```
    oc policy add-role-to-user view -n $(oc project -q) -z default
    ```

    We should see `clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/view added: "default"` as output. The next step is to create our `ConfigMap` configuration and deploy it to OpenShift using:

    ```
    cd /root/projects/rhoar-getting-started/spring/microservices-externalized-config && \
      oc create configmap spring-boot-configmap-greeting --from-file=src/main/etc/application.properties
    ```

    We will talk about `ConfigMap`s in greater detail in the next section.

    >**NOTE:** The only two parameters this command needs are the name of the ConfigMap to create and the file location. This command is creating a `ConfigMap` named `spring-boot-configmap-greeting`, which also happens to be the name of the application we're deploying. We're going to be using that name in future commands. If you decide to manually run the command or give the `ConfigMap` a different name, make sure you modify the other commands and configuration accordingly.

    Now we're ready to deploy!

    **3. Deploy the application to OpenShift**

    Run the following command to deploy the application to OpenShift:

    ```
    mvn oc:deploy -Popenshift
    ```

    There's a lot that happens here so lets break it down:

    For the deployment to OpenShift we are using the [JKube](https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/) tool through the [`openshift-maven-plugin`](https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/docs/openshift-maven-plugin), which is configured in our ``pom.xml`` (found in the `<profiles/>` section). The deployment may take a few minutes to complete.

    You can run the command

    ```
    oc rollout status -w dc/spring-boot-configmap-greeting
    ```

    to watch and wait for the deployment to complete.

    Once the application deployment completes, navigate to our route in the OpenShift Web Console.

    Access the OpenShift Web Console to login from the Web UI and access the `dev` project:

    ```
    oc get routes console -n openshift-console -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
    ```

    Copy the URL from the output of the above command or click to it to open it in your browser.

    We'll deploy our app as the `developer` user. Use the following credentials:

    * Username:
    ```
    admin
    ```

    * Password:
    ```
    admin
    ```

    or run this command to get the app's Route:

    ```
    oc get route spring-boot-configmap-greeting -n dev -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
    ```


    We should see the following screen, meaning everything was successful:

    ![Greeting Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/rhoar-microservices/greeting-service-mini.png)

    **4. Test functionality**

    As the page suggests, we're going to put in a name of a fruit and let our greeting service reply with a given greeting. Since our default value in our `ConfigMap` is `Greetings, you picked %s as your favorite fruit!`, that's what we should see after we fill in the textbox and click the button.

    ## Congratulations

    We've now deployed our application to OpenShift and we're ready to see how we can modify certain aspects of our application without downtime through the use of External Configuration via our ConfigMap.

    # Making modifications to the Configuration Map

    **1. The ConfigMap**

    `ConfigMap`s are a useful tool for decoupling configuration settings from the code. `ConfigMap`s can be used to inject configuration data into a container in much the same way that secrets do, though `ConfigMap`s should not store confidential information. `ConfigMap` objects hold key-pair values representing all of your configuration data.

    Notice the following dependency that was added to our `pom.xml`. This allows us to integrate with OpenShift's ConfigMaps.

    ```xml
         <dependency>
           <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-kubernetes-config</artifactId>
         </dependency>
    ```

    Click on the `Disk` icon to save the files or press `CTRL-S`:

    ![Visual Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/rhoar-microservices/save-pom-file.png)

    **2. Modify the ConfigMap**

    Let's modify the greeting that our service is returning to the user. Since we set up the greeting in a properties file, we will not need to make any code change to change the functionality. This means that we won't need to have any downtime for this change, we're able to modify the response through our newly created `ConfigMap` from the previous step. We can edit our config map in the OpenShift Console. Navigate to ConfigMaps section in the `dev` project and open our `ConfigMap` in a YAML editor.

    Change the `greeting.message` property to: `greeting.message=Bonjour, you picked %s as your favorite fruit!`

    ![Greeting Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/rhoar-microservices/editconfigmap.png)

    Hit `Save` (at the bottom of the editor) and that's all there is to it!

    **3. Test changes**

    Now that we've modified the `ConfigMap` and deployed our changes, let's test the greeting service and see if it's returning our new value.
    Go back to the app in your browser and put in a test value and click the button. Now instead of seeing `Greetings ...`, we should be seeing:

    `Bonjour, you picked %s as your favorite fruit!`

    This means that we were able to modify our application behavior through External Configuration of the `application.properties` file using a ConfigMap without having to even take down the application. That's pretty powerful!


    ## Congratulations

    You have now learned how to handle Externalized Configuration with ConfigMaps through OpenShift. By creating a `ConfigMap`, we're able to modify application properties on the fly and simply rollout the new changes to our application.
