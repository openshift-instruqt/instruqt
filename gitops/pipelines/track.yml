title: Using OpenShift Pipelines
description: |-
  In this self-paced tutorial, you will learn how to use OpenShift Pipelines to automate the deployment of your applications.

  In this tutorial, you will:
  * Install the OpenShift Pipelines Operator
  * Create a Hello World `Task`
  * Install task resource definitions
  * Create a Tekton `Pipeline`
  * Trigger the created pipeline to finish your application deployment.

  ## Getting started

  OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)
  solution for building pipelines using [Tekton](https://tekton.dev). Tekton is
  a flexible, Kubernetes-native, open-source CI/CD framework that enables automating
  deployments across multiple platforms (e.g. Kubernetes, serverless, VMs, and so forth) by
  abstracting away the underlying details.

  OpenShift Pipelines features:

  * Standard CI/CD pipeline definition based on Tekton
  * Build container images with tools such as [Source-to-Image (S2I)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/builds/understanding-image-builds.html#build-strategy-s2i_understanding-image-builds) and [Buildah](https://buildah.io/)
  * Deploy applications to multiple platforms such as Kubernetes, serverless, and VMs
  * Easy to extend and integrate with existing tools
  * Scale pipelines on-demand
  * Portable across any Kubernetes platform
  * Designed for microservices and decentralized teams
  * Integrated with the OpenShift Developer Console

  ## Tekton CRDs

  Tekton defines some [Kubernetes custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
  as building blocks to standardize pipeline concepts and provide terminology that is consistent across CI/CD solutions. These custom resources
  are an extension of the Kubernetes API that lets users create and interact with these objects using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`), `kubectl`, and other Kubernetes tools.

  The custom resources needed to define a pipeline are listed below:

  * `Task`: a reusable, loosely coupled number of steps that perform a specific task (e.g. building a container image)
  * `Pipeline`: the definition of the pipeline and the `Tasks` that it should perform
  * `TaskRun`: the execution and result of running an instance of a task
  * `PipelineRun`: the execution and result of running an instance of a pipeline, which includes a number of `TaskRuns`

  For further details on pipeline concepts, refer to the [Tekton documentation](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/master/docs#learn-more) that provides
  an excellent guide for understanding various parameters and attributes available for defining pipelines.

  In the following sections, you will go through each of the above steps to define and invoke a pipeline. Let's get started!

    OpenShift Pipelines are an OpenShift add-on that can be installed via an operator that is available in the OpenShift OperatorHub.

    You can either install the operator using the OpenShift Pipelines Operator in the web console or by using the CLI tool `oc`. Let's log in to our cluster to make changes and install the operator.

    At first, check that the pod responsible for OpenShift Web Console to be ready:

    ```
    oc get pods -n openshift-console | grep console
    ```

    You might have to wait a minute for the pod to be ready.

    When the pod is ready, execute the following command to find the route to the OpenShift Web Console:

    ```
    oc get routes console -n openshift-console
    ```

    Copy the link under `HOST/PORT` column and navigate there from a web browser.

    You will then be able to login with admin permissions with:

    * **Username:** ``admin``
    * **Password:** ``admin``

    ![Web Console Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/pipelines/web-console-login.png)

    ## Installing the OpenShift Pipelines Operator in Web Console

    You can install OpenShift Pipelines using the Operator listed in the OpenShift Container Platform OperatorHub. When you install the OpenShift Pipelines Operator, the Custom Resources (CRs) required for the Pipelines configuration are automatically installed along with the Operator.

    In the _Administrator_ perspective of the web console, navigate to Operators → OperatorHub. You can see the list of available operators for OpenShift provided by Red Hat as well as a community of partners and open-source projects.

    Use the _Filter by keyword_ box to search for `OpenShift Pipelines Operator` in the catalog. Click the _OpenShift Pipelines Operator_ tile.

    ![Web Console Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/pipelines/web-console-hub.png)

    Read the brief description of the Operator on the _OpenShift Pipelines Operator_ page. Click _Install_.

    Select _All namespaces on the cluster (default)_ for installation mode & _Automatic_ for the approval strategy. Click Subscribe!

    ![Web Console Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/pipelines/web-console-settings.png)

    Be sure to verify that the OpenShift Pipelines Operator has installed through the Operators → Installed Operators page.

    ## Installing the OpenShift Pipelines Operator using the CLI

    You can install OpenShift Pipelines Operator from the OperatorHub using the CLI.

    First, you'll want to create a Subscription object YAML file to subscribe a namespace to the OpenShift Pipelines Operator, for example, `subscription.yaml` as shown below:

    ```
    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Subscription
    metadata:
      name: openshift-pipelines-operator
      namespace: openshift-operators
    spec:
      channel: stable
      name: openshift-pipelines-operator-rh
      source: redhat-operators
      sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
    ```

    This YAML file defines various components, such as the `channel` specifying the channel name where we want to subscribe, `name` being the name of our Operator, and `source` being the CatalogSource that provides the operator.

    Create and save this file under `opt/operator` local folder as `subscription.yaml`.

    You can now create the Subscription object similar to any OpenShift object.

    ```
    oc apply -f /opt/operator/subscription.yaml
    ```

    ## Verify installation

    The OpenShift Pipelines Operator provides all its resources under a single API group: tekton.dev. This operation can take a few seconds; you can run the following script to monitor the progress of the installation.

    ```
    until oc api-resources --api-group=tekton.dev | grep tekton.dev &> /dev/null
    do
     echo "Operator installation in progress..."
     sleep 5
    done

    echo "Operator ready"
    ```

    Great! The OpenShift Pipelines Operator is now installed. Now, let's start the workshop.

  title: Step 2 - Create a New Project
  assignment: |
    For this tutorial, you're going to create a simple application that involves a [frontend](https://github.com/openshift/pipeliness-vote-ui) and [backend](https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-vote-api). This application needs to deploy in a new project (i.e. Kubernetes namespace). You can start by creating the project with:

    ```
    oc new-project pipelines-tutorial
    ```

    You can also deploy the same applications by applying the artifacts available in k8s directory of the respective repo.

    ## Deploying through Web Console

    If you deploy the application directly, you should be able to see the deployment in the OpenShift Web Console by switching over to the **Developer** perspective of the OpenShift Web Console. Change from **Administrator** to **Developer** from the drop-down as shown below:

    ![Web Console Developer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/pipelines/web-console-developer.png)

    Make sure you are on the `pipelines-tutorial` project by selecting it from the **Project** dropdown menu. Either search for `pipelines-tutorial` in the search bar or scroll down until you find `pipelines-tutorial` and click on the name of your project.

    ![Web Console Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/pipelines/web-console-project.png)

    Next, we'll work on creating a sample `Task` that outputs to the console!

  title: Step 3 - Create Sample Task
  assignment: |-
    A [`Task`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-labs/learn-katacoda/master/middleware/pipelines/assets/tasks/hello.yaml) defines a series of `steps` that run in a desired order and complete a set amount of build work. Every `Task` runs as a Pod on your Kubernetes cluster with each `step` as its own container. For example, the following `Task` outputs "Hello World":

    ```
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Task
    metadata:
      name: hello
    spec:
      steps:
        - name: say-hello
          image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
          command:
            - /bin/bash
          args: ['-c', 'echo Hello World']
    ```

    Apply this Task to your cluster just like any other Kubernetes object. Then run it using `tkn`, the CLI tool for Tekton.

    ```
    oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-labs/learn-katacoda/master/middleware/pipelines/assets/tasks/hello.yaml
    ```

    ```
    tkn task start --showlog hello
    ```

    The output will look similar to the following:

    ```
    TaskRun started: hello-run-9cp8x
    Waiting for logs to be available...
    [say-hello] Hello World
    ```

    In the next section, you will examine the task definitions that will be needed for our pipeline.

  title: Step 4 - Task Resource Definitions
  assignment: |-
    Tasks can also take parameters. This way, you can pass various flags to be used in this Task. These `params` can be instrumental in making your Tasks more generic and reusable across Pipelines. For example, a `Task` could apply a custom Kubernetes manifest, like the example below. This will be needed for deploying an image on OpenShift in our next section. In addition, we'll cover the `workspaces` during our `Pipeline` step.

    ```
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Task
    metadata:
      name: apply-manifests
    spec:
      workspaces:
      - name: source
      params:
        - name: manifest_dir
          description: The directory in source that contains yaml manifests
          type: string
          default: "k8s"
      steps:
        - name: apply
          image: quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:latest
          workingDir: /workspace/source
          command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
          args:
            - |-
              echo Applying manifests in $(inputs.params.manifest_dir) directory
              oc apply -f $(inputs.params.manifest_dir)
              echo -----------------------------------
    ```

    Create the `apply-manifests` task:

    ```
    oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-labs/learn-katacoda/master/middleware/pipelines/assets/tasks/apply_manifest_task.yaml
    ```

    We'll also create a `update-deployment` task, which can be seen with a `cat` command:

    ```
    oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-labs/learn-katacoda/master/middleware/pipelines/assets/tasks/update_deployment_task.yaml
    ```

    Finally, we can create a PersistentVolumeClaim to provide the filesystem for our pipeline execution, explained more in the next step:

    ```
    oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-labs/learn-katacoda/master/middleware/pipelines/assets/resources/persistent_volume_claim.yaml
    ```

    You can take a look at the tasks you created using the [Tekton CLI](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases):

    ```
    tkn task ls
    ```

    You should see similar output to this:

    ```
    NAME                DESCRIPTION   AGE
    apply-manifests                   4 seconds ago
    hello                             1 minute ago
    update-deployment                 3 seconds ago
    ```

    In the next section, you will create a pipeline that takes the source code of an application from GitHub and then builds and deploys it on OpenShift.

  title: Step 5 - Create Pipeline
  assignment: |-
    A `Pipeline` defines an ordered series of `Tasks` that you want to execute along with the corresponding inputs and outputs for each `Task`. In fact, tasks should do one single thing so you can reuse them across pipelines or even within a single pipeline.

    Below is an example definition of a `Pipeline`, created using the following diagram:

    ![Web Console Developer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/pipelines/pipeline-diagram.png)

    Below is a YAML file that represents the above pipeline:

    ```
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Pipeline
    metadata:
      name: build-and-deploy
    spec:
      workspaces:
      - name: shared-workspace
      params:
      - name: deployment-name
        type: string
        description: name of the deployment to be patched
      - name: git-url
        type: string
        description: url of the git repo for the code of deployment
      - name: git-revision
        type: string
        description: revision to be used from repo of the code for deployment
        default: "master"
      - name: IMAGE
        type: string
        description: image to be build from the code
      tasks:
      - name: fetch-repository
        taskRef:
          name: git-clone
          kind: ClusterTask
        workspaces:

          workspace: shared-workspace
        params:
        - name: url

        - name: subdirectory
          value: ""
        - name: deleteExisting
          value: "true"
        - name: revision

          value: "false"
        - name: IMAGE
          value: $(params.IMAGE)
        workspaces:
        - name: source
          workspace: shared-workspace
        runAfter:
        - fetch-repository
      - name: apply-manifests
        taskRef:
          name: apply-manifests
        workspaces:
        - name: source
          workspace: shared-workspace
        runAfter:
        - build-image
      - name: update-deployment
        taskRef:
          name: update-deployment
        workspaces:
        - name: source
          workspace: shared-workspace
        params:
        - name: deployment
          value: $(params.deployment-name)
        - name: IMAGE
          value: $(params.IMAGE)
        runAfter:
        - apply-manifests
    ```

    This pipeline helps you to build and deploy backend/frontend, by configuring the right resources to the pipeline.

    Pipeline Steps:

      1. `fetch-repository` clones the source code of the application from a git repository by referring (`git-url` and `git-revision` param)
      2. `build-image` builds the container image of the application using the `buildah` clustertask
      that uses [Buildah](https://buildah.io/) to build the image
      3. The application image is pushed to an image registry by referring (`image` param)
      4. The new application image is deployed on OpenShift using the `apply-manifests` and `update-deployment` tasks

    You might have noticed that there are no references to the git repository or the image registry it will be pushed to in the pipeline. That's because pipeline in Tekton is designed to be generic and re-usable across environments and stages through the application's lifecycle. Pipelines abstract away the specifics of the git
    source repository and image to be produced as [`PipelineResources`](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/resources) or `Params`. When triggering a pipeline, you can provide different git repositories and image registries to be used during pipeline execution.

    The execution order of task is determined by dependencies that are defined between the tasks via inputs and outputs as well as explicit orders that are defined via `runAfter`.

    `workspaces` field allows you to specify one or more volumes that each Task in the Pipeline requires during execution. You specify one or more Workspaces in the `workspaces` field.

    Create the pipeline by running the following:

    ```
    oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-labs/learn-katacoda/master/middleware/pipelines/assets/pipeline/pipeline.yaml
    ```

    In the next section, you will focus on creating a trigger to execute the tasks specified in the pipeline.

  type: challenge
  title: Step 6 - Trigger a Pipeline
  assignment: |
    Now that the pipeline is created, you can trigger it to execute the tasks specified in the pipeline. This is done by creating a `PipelineRun` via `tkn`.

    # Trigger a Pipeline via CLI

    Let's start a pipeline to build and deploy our backend application using `tkn`. By creating a `PipelineRun` with the name of our applied `Pipeline`, we can define various arguments to our command like `params` that will be used in the `Pipeline`.  For example, we can apply a request for storage with a `persistentVolumeClaim`, as well as define a name for our `deployment`, `git-url` repository to be cloned, and `IMAGE` to be created.

    We'll first build and deploy our backend application using the following command, with the params already included for our specific demo:

    ```
    tkn pipeline start build-and-deploy -w name=shared-workspace,claimName=source-pvc -p deployment-name=pipelines-vote-api -p git-url=https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-vote-api.git -p IMAGE=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/pipelines-tutorial/vote-api -p git-revision=master --showlog
    ```

    Similarly, start a pipeline to build and deploy the frontend application:

    ```
    tkn pipeline start build-and-deploy -w name=shared-workspace,claimName=source-pvc -p deployment-name=pipelines-vote-ui -p git-url=https://github.com/openshift/pipelines-vote-ui.git -p IMAGE=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/pipelines-tutorial/vote-ui -p git-revision=master --showlog
    ```

    As soon as you start the `build-and-deploy` pipeline, a `PipelineRun` will be instantiated and pods will be created to execute the tasks that are defined in the pipeline. To display a list of Pipelines, use the following command:

    ```
    tkn pipeline ls
    ```

    Again, notice the reusability of pipelines, and how one generic `Pipeline` can be triggered with various `params`. We've started the `build-and-deploy` pipeline, with relevant pipeline resources to deploy backend/frontend application using a single pipeline. Let's list our PipelineRuns:

    ```
    tkn pipelinerun ls
    ```

    After a few minutes, the pipeline should finish successfully!

    ```
    tkn pipelinerun ls
    ```

    ## Access Pipeline via Web Console

    To view the `PipelineRun` visually, visit the Pipelines section of the developer perspective. From here, you can see the details of our `Pipeline`, including the YAML file we've applied, the `PipelineRun`, input custom `params`, and more:

    Congrats! Your `Pipeline` has successfully ran, and the final step will provide instructions on how to access the deployed image.

  title: Step 7 - Verify Deployment
  assignment: |-
    To verify a successful deployment for our application, head back out to the web console by clicking on the Console at the center top of the workshop in your browser.

    Click on the Topology tab on the left side of the web console. You should see something similar to what is shown in the screenshot below:

    ![Web Console Deployed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/pipelines/application-deployed.png)

    The Topology view of the OpenShift web console helps to show what is deployed out to your OpenShift project visually. As mentioned earlier, the dark blue lining around the _ui_ circle means that a container has started up and running the _api_ application. By clicking on the arrow icon as shown below, you can open the URL for _ui_ in a new tab and see the application running.

    ![Web Console URL Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-instruqt/instruqt/master/assets/middleware/pipelines/url-icon.png)

    After clicking on the icon, you should see the application running in a new tab.

    ## Accessing application via CLI

    In addition, you can get the route of the application by executing the following command to access the application.

    ```
