- assignment: 'The Jupyter on OpenShift project provides Jupyter notebook images which
    have been purpose built to work best with OpenShift.


    Before you can deploy these Jupyter notebook images, you first need to load the
    images for the Jupyter notebook application into your project in OpenShift. You
    only need to load this once in a project. You can then use it in creating as many
    different Jupyter notebook deployments as you need.


    In this workshop the step of loading the Jupyter notebook images has already been
    done for you.


    To verify that the images have been loaded run the command:


    ```

    oc get imagestreams -o name

    ```


    You should see that the `s2i-minimal-notebook` image stream exists.


    You can inspect the image stream by running:


    ```

    oc describe imagestream s2i-minimal-notebook

    ```


    You should see that the image stream includes tags for `3.5` and `3.6`. These
    correspond to versions of the image for Python 3.5 and Python 3.6.

  title: Topic 1 - Loading the Notebook Images
  type: challenge
- assignment: 'The minimal Jupyter notebook images that have been loaded can be deployed
    as is, but to make it easier to secure access, add persistent storage, define
    resources, as well as use it as a Source-to-Image (S2I) builder to create custom
    Jupyter notebook images, the Jupyter on OpenShift project also provides a set
    of OpenShift templates.


    As with the Jupyter notebook images, for this workshop these have already been
    loaded for you.


    To verify that the templates have been loaded for you, run:


    ```

    oc get templates

    ```


    The purpose of the OpenShift templates which have been loaded are:


    * `notebook-deployer` - Template for deploying a Jupyter notebook image.


    * `notebook-builder` - Template for building a custom Jupyter notebook image using
    Source-to-Image (S2I) against a hosted Git repository. Python packages listed
    in the `requirements.txt` file of the Git repository will be installed and any
    files, including notebook images, will be copied into the image. The image can
    then be deployed using the `notebook-deployer` template.


    * `notebook-quickstart` - Template for building and deploying a custom Jupyter
    notebook image. This combines the functionality of the `notebook-builder` and
    `notebook-deployer` templates.


    * `notebook-workspace` - Template for deploying a Jupyter notebook instance which
    also attaches a persistent volume, and copies any Python packages and notebooks
    included in the image, into the persistent volume. Any work done on the notebooks,
    or to install additional Python packages, will survive a restart of the Jupyter
    notebook environment. A webdav interface is also enabled to allow remote mounting
    of the persistent volume to a local computer.


    In this workshop you will be using the `notebook-deployer` template.


    To see details about this template and what parameters can be provided when using
    the template, run the command:


    ```

    oc describe template notebook-deployer

    ```


    Check out the other workshops available here for more information on this and
    the other templates.

  type: challenge
- assignment: 'To deploy a Jupyter notebook using the `notebook-deployer` template,
    you can use the command line or the OpenShift web console. We will use the web
    console in this example.


    Click on the _Console_ tab in the workshop dashboard. You will be presented with
    the OpenShift login screen.


    ![Web Console Login](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/03-web-console-login.png)


    For the credentials, enter:


    * **Username:** ``developer``

    * **Password:** ``developer``


    Once you have logged in, you should be shown the list of projects you have access
    to. A project called ``myproject`` has already been created for you to use in
    this workshop.


    ![List of Projects](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/03-list-of-projects.png)


    Click on ``myproject`` and you should then be at the _Overview_ page for

    the project. Select the _Developer_ perspective for the project instead of the
    _Adminstrator_ perspective in the left hand side menu. If necessary click on the
    hamburger menu icon top left of the web console to expose the left hand side menu.


    ![Add to Project](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/03-add-to-project.png)


    As the project is currently empty, no workloads should be found and you will be
    presented with various options for how you can deploy an application.


    Once you have deployed a workload, you can return to this view to deploy additional
    applications by selecting the _+Add_ option in the left hand side menu.

    Ensure that _All Items_ is selected on the left hand side, and in the _Filter
    by keyword_ text entry field enter ``jupyter``. This will limit the displayed
    items to just the OpenShift templates you loaded.


    ![Add to Project](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/04-jupyter-notebook-templates.png)


    Click on the tile for _Jupyter Notebook_.


    This will bring up the description of the template. Click on _Instantiate Template_,
    which will bring up a form with the parameters for the template which you can
    customize.


    ![Instatiate Template](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/04-instantiate-template.png)


    The purpose of the template parameters are:


    * ``APPLICATION_NAME`` - The name of the deployment.

    * ``NOTEBOOK_IMAGE`` - The name of the image stream for the Jupyter notebook image,
    and the version tag, which you wish to use.

    * ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` - The password used to protect access to the Jupyter notebook.
    This cannot be left empty.

    * ``NOTEBOOK_INTERFACE`` - The Jupyter notebook web interface to use. Setting
    this to ``lab`` will enable the JupyterLab web interface.

    * ``NOTEBOOK_MEMORY`` - The maximum amount of memory the Jupyter noteboook deployment
    is allowed to use.


    In the ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` field enter a password of ``secret``, and then click
    on _Create_. The _Template Instance Overview_ view for the deployment will be
    displayed.


    To monitor the deployment, click on the _Topology_ view in the left hand side
    menu.


    ![Topology View](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/04-topology-view.png)


    The ring shown in the visualization of the deployment will change from white,
    indicating the deployment is pending, to light blue, indicating the application
    is starting, and finally blue, indicating the application is running.


    The icon top right of the ring is a short cut to access the URL for the deployment.
    Once the ring has turned blue indicating the application is running, click on
    this icon, which will open a new browser tab or window for the Jupyter notebook.


    Because a secure HTTP connection is used, but an environment may in some cases
    use a self signed SSL certificate, you will need to accept the certificate to
    proceed.


    ![Login Prompt](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/04-notebook-login-prompt.png)


    At the login prompt, enter the password ``secret`` which you entered into the
    ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` field. You will then be granted access to the Jupyter notebook
    file browser.


    ![Classic Notebook](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/04-classic-notebook-interface.png)


    At this point you can create new notebooks or upload existing notebooks. If you
    need to install additional Python packages, when using this type of deployment
    you would need to start a terminal from the Jupyter notebook web interface and
    install the packages manually.


    In this configuration nothing is persistent. If the notebook instance were restarted,
    you would loose any work. For a persistent workspace, the ``notebook-workspace``
    template can be used. Details of how to use this template are described in a separate
    workshop.

description: 'The [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) web site describes Jupyter
  notebooks as:


  > an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that
  contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data
  cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization,
  machine learning, and much more.


  Jupyter notebooks can be deployed direct to Linux, macOS or Windows environments,
  or in containerized environments such as Docker, Kubernetes and OpenShift.


  In this workshop you will learn how you can deploy and use Jupyter notebooks in
  OpenShift.


  The examples shown will make use of sample Jupyter notebook images and templates
  from the [Jupyter on OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift) project,
  a community project for demonstrating how Jupyter notebooks and JupyterHub can be
  deployed to OpenShift.
