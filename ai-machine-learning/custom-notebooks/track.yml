- assignment: 'The Jupyter on OpenShift project provides Jupyter notebook images which
    have been purpose built to work best with OpenShift.


    Before you can deploy these Jupyter notebook images, you first need to load the
    images for the Jupyter notebook application into your project in OpenShift. You
    only need to load this once in a project. You can then use it in creating as many
    different Jupyter notebook deployments as you need.


    In this workshop the step of loading the Jupyter notebook images has already been
    done for you.


    To verify that the images have been loaded run the command:


    ```

    oc get imagestreams -o name

    ```


    You should see that the `s2i-minimal-notebook` image stream exists.


    You can inspect the image stream by running:


    ```

    oc describe imagestream s2i-minimal-notebook

    ```


    You should see that the image stream includes tags for `3.5` and `3.6`. These
    correspond to versions of the image for Python 3.5 and Python 3.6.

  title: Topic 1 - Loading the Notebook Images
  type: challenge
- assignment: 'The minimal Jupyter notebook images that have been loaded can be deployed
    as is, but to make it easier to secure access, add persistent storage, define
    resources, as well as use it as a Source-to-Image (S2I) builder to create custom
    Jupyter notebook images, the Jupyter on OpenShift project also provides a set
    of OpenShift templates.


    As with the Jupyter notebook images, for this workshop these have already been
    loaded for you.


    To verify that the templates have been loaded for you, run:


    ```

    oc get templates

    ```


    The purpose of the OpenShift templates which have been loaded are:


    * `notebook-deployer` - Template for deploying a Jupyter notebook image.


    * `notebook-builder` - Template for building a custom Jupyter notebook image using
    Source-to-Image (S2I) against a hosted Git repository. Python packages listed
    in the `requirements.txt` file of the Git repository will be installed and any
    files, including notebook images, will be copied into the image. The image can
    then be deployed using the `notebook-deployer` template.


    * `notebook-quickstart` - Template for building and deploying a custom Jupyter
    notebook image. This combines the functionality of the `notebook-builder` and
    `notebook-deployer` templates.


    * `notebook-workspace` - Template for deploying a Jupyter notebook instance which
    also attaches a persistent volume, and copies any Python packages and notebooks
    included in the image, into the persistent volume. Any work done on the notebooks,
    or to install additional Python packages, will survive a restart of the Jupyter
    notebook environment. A webdav interface is also enabled to allow remote mounting
    of the persistent volume to a local computer.


    In this workshop you will be using the `notebook-builder`, `notebook-deployer`
    and `notebook-quickstart` templates.


    To see details about the builder template and what parameters can be provided
    when using the template, run the command:


    ```

    oc describe template notebook-builder

    ```


    To see details about the deployer template and what parameters can be provided
    when using the template, run the command:


    ```

    oc describe template notebook-deployer

    ```


    To see details about the quickstart template and what parameters can be provided
    when using the template, run the command:


    ```

    oc describe template notebook-quickstart

    ```


    Check out the other workshops available here for more information on these and
    the other templates.

  type: challenge
- assignment: 'You can work with the templates using either the command line or the
    OpenShift web console. We will use the web console in this example.


    Click on the _Console_ tab in the workshop dashboard. You will be presented with
    the OpenShift login screen.


    ![Web Console Login](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/03-web-console-login.png)


    For the credentials, enter:


    * **Username:** ``developer``

    * **Password:** ``developer``


    Once you have logged in, you should be shown the list of projects you have access
    to. A project called ``myproject`` has already been created for you to use in
    this workshop.


    ![List of Projects](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/03-list-of-projects.png)


    Click on ``myproject`` and you should then be at the _Overview_ page for

    the project. Select the _Developer_ perspective for the project instead of the
    _Adminstrator_ perspective in the left hand side menu. If necessary click on the
    hamburger menu icon top left of the web console to expose the left hand side menu.


    ![Add to Project](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-notebooks-42/03-add-to-project.png)


    As the project is currently empty, no workloads should be found and you will be
    presented with various options for how you can deploy an application.


    Once you have deployed a workload, you can return to this view to deploy additional
    applications by selecting the _+Add_ option in the left hand side menu.

  type: challenge
- assignment: 'In the separate workshop _Deploying a Jupyter Notebook Image_ we already
    saw how the `notebook-deployer` template could be used to deploy an instance of
    a Jupyter notebook environment. This environment was empty and you would have
    needed to upload any existing notebooks you wanted to use, as well as manually
    install into the environment any additional Python packages required by the notebooks.


    In this workshop we are going to create a custom Jupyter notebook image which
    includes any notebook files you require, as well as having any Python packages
    they need already installed. The result is a container image that can be redistributed
    and made available to others, or, using the same process as will be shown, someone
    else could build their own container image from your original files. Once the
    custom Jupyter notebook image has been created, we will deploy it.


    From the options for deploying applications to your project, select _From Catalog_.
    This will bring up the _Developer Catalog_.


    Ensure that _All Items_ is selected on the left hand side, and in the _Filter
    by keyword_ text entry field enter ``jupyter``. This will limit the displayed
    items to just the OpenShift templates you loaded.

    Click on the tile for _Jupyter Notebook Builder_.


    This will bring up the description of the template. Click on _Instantiate Template_,
    which will bring up a form with the parameters for the template which you can
    customize.


    ![Instatiate Template](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/custom-notebooks-42/04-instantiate-template.png)


    The purpose of the template parameters are:


    * ``NOTEBOOK_NAME`` - The name to be given to the custom notebook image.

    * ``BUILDER_IMAGE`` - The name and version of the Jupyter notebook image to be
    used as the base for building the custom notebook image.

    * ``GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`` - The URL to a hosted Git repository containing the Jupyter
    notebook files, and a Python ``requirements.txt`` file listing any Python packages
    required by the notebook files.

    * ``GIT_REFERENCE`` - The branch of the Git repository to use.

    * ``CONTEXT_DIR`` - Where files to be used to build the custom notebook image
    are located in a sub directory of the Git repository, the name of that sub directory.


    In the ``GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`` field enter the URL:


    ``https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/sample-notebooks``


    In the ``CONTEXT_DIR`` field enter:


    ``matplotlib``


    Click on _Create_ to instantiate the template. This will leave you on the _Template
    Instance Overview_ with details of what was created.


    Usually a template is used to create a deployment for an application. In this
    case it has created a build configuration and triggered a build of a custom notebook
    image, using the files held in the Git repository you provided to the template.


    To monitor the building of the custom notebook image, run:


    ```

    oc logs -f bc/custom-notebook

    ```


    The build may take a few moments to start as it pulls down the builder image to
    use.


    The build process will then use the builder image as a base for your custom notebook
    image, injecting into the image the source code files from the Git repository,
    and installing any Python packages listed in the Python ``requirements.txt`` file.


    One of the items created by the template is an image stream, with it defining
    the destination for the image which is built.


    List the image streams in the project by running:


    ```

    oc get imagestreams -o name

    ```


    You will see there are now two image streams, the `s2i-minimal-notebook` which
    was used as the builder image, and the the `custom-notebook` image, which was
    created by the build.

    The purpose of the template parameters are:


    * ``APPLICATION_NAME`` - The name of the deployment.

    * ``NOTEBOOK_IMAGE`` - The name of the image stream for the Jupyter notebook image,
    and the version tag, which you wish to use.

    * ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` - The password used to protect access to the Jupyter notebook.
    This cannot be left empty.

    * ``NOTEBOOK_INTERFACE`` - The Jupyter notebook web interface to use. Setting
    this to ``lab`` will enable the JupyterLab web interface.

    * ``NOTEBOOK_MEMORY`` - The maximum amount of memory the Jupyter noteboook deployment
    is allowed to use.


    In the ``NOTEBOOK_IMAGE`` field, change the value from ``s2i-mininal-notebook:3.6``
    to ``custom-notebook:latest``. This corresponds to the name of the image the build
    created.


    In the ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` field enter a password of ``secret``.


    When ready, click on _Create_. The _Template Instance Overview_ view for the deployment
    will be displayed.


    To monitor the deployment, click on the _Topology_ view in the left hand side
    menu.


    ![Topology View](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/custom-notebooks-42/05-topology-view.png)


    The ring shown in the visualization of the deployment will change from white,
    indicating the deployment is pending, to light blue, indicating the application
    is starting, and finally blue, indicating the application is running.


    The icon top right of the ring is a short cut to access the URL for the deployment.
    Once the ring has turned blue indicating the application is running, click on
    this icon, which will open a new browser tab or window for the Jupyter notebook.


    Because a secure HTTP connection is used, but an environment may in some cases
    use a self signed SSL certificate, you will need to accept the certificate to
    proceed.


    ![Login Prompt](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/custom-notebooks-42/05-notebook-login-prompt.png)


    At the login prompt, enter the password ``secret`` which you entered into the
    ``NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD`` field. You will then be granted access to the Jupyter notebook
    file browser.


    ![Classic Notebook](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/custom-notebooks-42/05-classic-notebook-interface.png)


    From the file browser you will see the the Jupyter notebook file and the ``requirements.txt``
    file from the Git repository. The Python packages listed in the ``requirements.txt``
    file have also been installed. If you were to open the notebook file you will
    be able to interact with and execute the cells.


    In this configuration nothing is persistent. If the notebook instance were restarted,
    you would loose any work. For a persistent workspace, the ``notebook-workspace``
    template can be used. Details of how to use this template are described in a separate
    workshop.
