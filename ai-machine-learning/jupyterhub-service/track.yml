- assignment: 'The Jupyter on OpenShift project provides Jupyter notebook and JupyterHub
    images which have been purpose built to work best with OpenShift.


    Before you can deploy JupyterHub, you first need to load the images for the Jupyter
    notebook application and JupyterHub into your project in OpenShift. You only need
    to load this once in a project. You can then use it in creating as many different
    JupyterHub deployments as you need.


    In this workshop the step of loading the Jupyter notebook and JupyterHub images
    has already been done for you.


    To verify that the images have been loaded run the command:


    ```

    oc get imagestreams -o name

    ```



    You should see that the `s2i-minimal-notebook` and `jupyterhub` image stream exists.


    You can inspect the image stream by running:


    ```

    oc describe imagestream s2i-minimal-notebook

    ```


    You should see that the image stream includes tags for `3.5` and `3.6`. These
    correspond to versions of the image for Python 3.5 and Python 3.6.


    When deploying JupyterHub, either of these images for the Jupyter notebook can
    be used, or a custom Jupyter notebook image you built could instead be used.

  title: Topic 1 - Loading the Required Images
  type: challenge
- assignment: 'Deploying JupyterHub requires a bit more work to setup than just deploying
    the JupyterHub image, so templates are available to make this task easier.


    As with the Jupyter notebook and JupyterHub images, for this workshop these have
    already been loaded for you.


    To verify that the templates have been loaded for you, run:


    ```

    oc get templates

    ```


    The purpose of the OpenShift templates which have been loaded are:


    * `jupyterhub-deployer` - Template for deploying a JupyterHub service using an
    existing Jupyter notebook image.


    * `jupyterhub-builder` - Template for building a custom JupyterHub image using
    Source-to-Image (S2I) against a hosted Git repository. Custom JupyterHub configuration
    will be combined with the base JupyterHub image.


    * `jupyterhub-quickstart` - Template for deploying a JupyterHub service, using
    a custom Jupyter notebook image built using Source-to-Image (S2I).


    * `notebook-builder` - Template for building a custom Jupyter notebook image using
    Source-to-Image (S2I) against a hosted Git repository.


    In this workshop you will be using the `jupyterhub-deployer`, `jupyterhub-builder`
    and `jupyterhub-quickstart` templates.


    To see details about the `jupyterhub-deployer` template and what parameters can
    be provided when using the template, run the command:


    ```

    oc describe template jupyterhub-deployer

    ```


    To see details about the `jupyterhub-builder` template and what parameters can
    be provided when using the template, run the command:


    ```

    oc describe template jupyterhub-builder

    ```


    To see details about the `jupyterhub-quickstart` template and what parameters
    can be provided when using the template, run the command:


    ```

    oc describe template jupyterhub-quickstart

    ```

  type: challenge
- assignment: 'You can work with the templates using either the command line or the
    OpenShift web console. We will use the web console in this example.


    Click on the _Console_ tab in the workshop dashboard. You will be presented with
    the OpenShift login screen.


    ![Web Console Login](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyterhub-service-42/03-web-console-login.png)


    For the credentials, enter:


    * **Username:** ``developer``

    * **Password:** ``developer``


    Once you have logged in, you should be shown the list of projects you have access
    to. A project called ``myproject`` has already been created for you to use in
    this workshop.


    ![List of Projects](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyterhub-service-42/03-list-of-projects.png)


    Click on ``myproject`` and you should then be at the _Overview_ page for

    the project. Select the _Developer_ perspective for the project instead of the
    _Adminstrator_ perspective in the left hand side menu. If necessary click on the
    hamburger menu icon top left of the web console to expose the left hand side menu.


    ![Add to Project](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyterhub-service-42/03-add-to-project.png)


    As the project is currently empty, no workloads should be found and you will be
    presented with various options for how you can deploy an application.


    Once you have deployed a workload, you can return to this view to deploy additional
    applications by selecting the _+Add_ option in the left hand side menu.

    customize.


    ![Instatiate Template](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyterhub-service-42/04-instantiate-template.png)


    The purpose of the template parameters are:


    * ``APPLICATION_NAME`` - The name of the deployment.

    * ``JUPYTERHUB_IMAGE`` - The name of the image stream for the JupyterHub image,
    and the version tag, which you wish to use.

    * ``NOTEBOOK_IMAGE`` - The name of the image stream for the Jupyter notebook image,
    and the version tag, which you wish to use.

    * ``JUPYTERHUB_CONFIG`` - Contents for a custom `jupyterhub_config.py` file to
    override any JupyterHub defaults.

    * ``JUPYTERHUB_ENVVARS`` - Contents for a shell script to be executed to set any
    special environment variables to customise the JupyterHub deployment.

    * ``DATABASE_PASSWORD`` - Password for accessing the database used by JupyterHub.

    * ``COOKIE_SECRET`` - Secret used with cookies to encode information about the
    JupyterHub session.

    * ``JUPYTERHUB_MEMORY`` - The maximum amount of memory the JupyterHub deployment
    is allowed to use.

    * ``DATABASE_MEMORY`` - The maximum amount of memory the JupyterHub database application
    is allowed to use.

    * ``NOTEBOOK_MEMORY`` - The maximum amount of memory each Jupyter noteboook deployment
    is allowed to use.


    For this example, you can leave all the fields as there default values. This means
    we will use an empty Jupyter notebook image. You could instead use the ``notebook-builder``
    template to first build your own custom Jupyter notebook image and use it instead.


    Click on _Create_. The _Template Instance Overview_ view for the deployment will
    be displayed.


    To monitor the deployment, click on the _Topology_ view in the left hand side
    menu.


    ![Topology View](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyterhub-service-42/04-topology-view.png)


    You will see two deployments, one for JupyterHub and one for a PostgreSQL database
    it uses to store information.


    The rings shown in the visualization for the deployments will change from white,
    indicating a deployment is pending, to light blue, indicating the application
    is starting, and finally blue, indicating the application is running.


    The icon top right of the ring for the JupyterHub deployment is a short cut to
    access the URL for the deployment. Once the ring has turned blue indicating the
    application is running, click on this icon, which will open a new browser tab
    or window.


    Because a secure HTTP connection is used, but an environment may in some cases
    use a self signed SSL certificate, you will need to accept the certificate to
    proceed.


    In this deployment of JupyterHub, user authentication is not required and you
    will be assigned a temporary identity.


    What you will see is a progress screen as a separate Jupyter notebook instance
    is started up for you. Once the instance has started, you will have access to
    the Jupyter notebook file browser.


    ![Classic Notebook](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyter-workspace-42/04-classic-notebook-interface.png)


    At this point you can create new notebooks or upload existing notebooks. If you
    need to install additional Python packages, when using this type of deployment
    you would need to start a terminal from the Jupyter notebook web interface and
    install the packages manually.


    In this configuration nothing is persistent. If the notebook instance were restarted,
    you would loose any work.


    Because JupyterHub is used to handle spawning of JupyterHub notebook instances
    on demand, a separate user visiting the same URL, will be given access to their
    own notebook session.

  title: Topic 5 - Deleting the JupyterHub Service
  type: challenge
- assignment: 'The default configuration for the JupyterHub service created allows
    for anonymous access and nothing is persistent.


    JupyterHub is however a highly configurable system. The template and JupyterHub
    image provide a starting point which you can build on, to customize it for your
    specific requirements. This includes being able to use your own authentication
    provider to control who can access the service, or add persistence for authenticated
    user sessions.


    Depending on the type of configuration required, and whether additional application
    services need to be created, there are a number of different methods you can use
    to customize the deployment.


    The first of these is to provide configuration through the template parameters.
    To do this we will create the deployment from the command line by running:


    ```

    oc process jupyterhub-deployer --param JUPYTERHUB_CONFIG="`cat jupyterhub_config.py`"
    --param JUPYTERHUB_ENVVARS="`cat jupyterhub_config.sh`" | oc apply -f -

    ```


    This will supply configuration which configures the JupyterHub service to use
    OpenShift as the authentication mechanism to control who can access the service.
    Only users who have an existing user account in the OpenShift cluster will be
    able to access the service.


    To monitor the deployment run:


    ```

    oc rollout status dc/jupyterhub

    ```


    When complete, jump back to the _Topology_ view of the web console and click on
    the URL short cut for the application to access it. This time when you access
    the JupyterHub service, you should be prompted to login with your OpenShift cluster
    credentials first.


    For the credentials, enter:


    * **Username:** ``developer``

    * **Password:** ``developer``


    When you have verified access, delete the JupyterHub service again:


    ```

    oc delete all,configmap,pvc,serviceaccount,rolebinding --selector app=jupyterhub

    ```

  title: Topic 6 - Customizing the Configuration
  type: challenge
- assignment: 'If the required configuration is too complex to provide via the template
    parameters, you need to include additional files, or install extra Python packages
    to support a particular authentication provider, you can use the JupyterHub image
    as a Source-to-Image (S2I) builder to create a custom JupyterHub image.


    From the web console click on _+Add_ in the left hand side menu and select _From
    Catalog_. In the _Developer Catalog_, enter ``jupyter`` into the _Filter by keyword_
    text entry box.


    This time select _JupyterHub Builder_ from the catalog entries shown.


    This will bring up the description of the template. Click on _Instantiate Template_,
    which will bring up a form with the parameters for the template which you can
    customize.


    ![Instantiate Template](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyterhub-service-42/07-instantiate-template.png)


    The purpose of the template parameters are:


    * ``JUPYTERHUB_NAME`` - The name to be given to the custom JupyterHub image.

    * ``BUILDER_IMAGE`` - The name and version of the JupyterHub image to be used
    as the base for building the custom notebook image.

    * ``GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`` - The URL to a hosted Git repository containing the JupyterHub
    configuration, and a Python ``requirements.txt`` file listing any Python packages
    if required.

    * ``GIT_REFERENCE`` - The branch of the Git repository to use.

    * ``CONTEXT_DIR`` - Where files to be used to build the custom JupyterHub image
    are located in a sub directory of the Git repository, the name of that sub directory.


    In the ``GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`` field enter the URL:


    ``https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/poc-hub-openshift-auth``


    In the ``CONTEXT_DIR`` field enter:


    ``jupyterhub``


    Click on _Create_ to instantiate the template. This will leave you on the _Template
    Instance Overview_ with details of what was created.


    Usually a template is used to create a deployment for an application. In this
    case it has created a build configuration and triggered a build of a custom JupyterHub
    image, using the files held in the Git repository you provided to the template.


    To monitor the building of the custom JupyterHub image, run:


    ```

    oc logs -f bc/custom-jupyterhub

    ```


    The build process will then use the builder image as a base for your custom JupyterHub
    image, injecting into the image the source code files from the Git repository,
    and installing any Python packages listed in the Python ``requirements.txt`` file.


    One of the items created by the template is an image stream, with it defining
    the destination for the image which is built.


    Once the build has completed, list the image streams in the project by running:


    ```

    oc get imagestreams -o name

    ```


    You will see there are now multiple JupyterHub image streams. The original ``jupyterhub``
    image, and the ``custom-jupyterhub`` image.


    Return again to the web console, and click on _+Add_ in the left hand side menu
    and select _From Catalog_. In the _Developer Catalog_, enter ``jupyter`` into
    the _Filter by keyword_ text entry box.


    Select _JupyterHub_ from the catalog entries shown and then _Instantiate Template_.


    In the list of template parameters, change the value of ``JUPYTERHUB_IMAGE`` to
    ``custom-jupyterhub:latest``. This is the name and version of the custom  JupyterHub
    image you just created.


    Click on _Create_ and return to the _Topology_ view to wait for the deployment
    to complete. When done, click on the URL short cut icon to open the application.
    You will once again be asked to login using OpenShift credentials.


    When you have verified access, delete the JupyterHub service again:


    ```

    oc delete all,configmap,pvc,serviceaccount,rolebinding --selector app=jupyterhub

    ```


    For details on how to structure the directory in the Git repository used as input
    to a custom JupyterHub image build, see the `jupyterhub` directory of:


    * https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/poc-hub-openshift-auth


    As well as serving as input to an S2I build, this Git repository can also be built
    using a ``Dockerfile`` build, and includes an example of using custom templates
    to provide alternate options for deployment.


    A further example which uses templates to deploy additional services, in this
    case a KeyCloak service to act as the authentication provider, is:

  title: Topic 7 - Source to Image Builder
  type: challenge
- assignment: 'In the examples so far in this workshop, an empty Jupyter notebook
    image was used. It was mentioned that you could use the `notebook-builder` template
    to build a custom Jupyter notebook image first, and then use that when deploying
    the JupyterHub service.


    An alternative which allows this to be done in one step, is the ``jupyterhub-quickstart``
    template.


    Return again to the web console, and click on _+Add_ in the left hand side menu
    and select _From Catalog_. In the _Developer Catalog_, enter ``jupyter`` into
    the _Filter by keyword_ text entry box.


    Select _JupyterHub Quickstart_ from the catalog entries shown and then _Instantiate
    Template_.


    ![Instantiate Template](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/jupyternotebooks/jupyterhub-service-42/08-instantiate-template.png)


    This combines aspects of the ``notebook-builder`` and ``jupyterhub-deployer``
    templates. In this case the template parameters below relate to the building of
    a custom Jupyter notebook image.


    * ``BUILDER_IMAGE`` - The name and version of the Jupyter notebook image to be
    used as the base for building the custom notebook image.

    * ``GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`` - The URL to a hosted Git repository containing the Jupyter
    notebook files, and a Python ``requirements.txt`` file listing any Python packages
    required by the notebook files.

    * ``GIT_REFERENCE`` - The branch of the Git repository to use.

    * ``CONTEXT_DIR`` - Where files to be used to build the custom notebook image
    are located in a sub directory of the Git repository, the name of that sub directory.


    In the list of template parameters, change the value of ``JUPYTERHUB_IMAGE`` to
    ``custom-jupyterhub:latest``. This is so we use the existing custom JupyterHub
    image with authentication again.


    In the ``GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`` field enter the URL:


    ``https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/sample-notebooks``


    In the ``CONTEXT_DIR`` field enter:


    ``matplotlib``


    Click on _Create_ to instantiate the template. This will leave you on the _Template
    Instance Overview_ with details of what was created.


    Two things will happen this time. The JupyterHub service will be deployed, and
    in parallel, the custom Jupyter notebook image will be built. Before we can access
    the JupyterHub service, we need to wait until the Jupyter notebook image has been
    built, so monitor it by running:


    ```

    oc logs -f bc/jupyterhub-nb

    ```


    When the build has completed, use the URL short cut icon in the _Topology_ view
    to access the JupyterHub service.


    This time after you get past the authentication and the Jupyter notebook file
    browser web interface is displayed, you will see that a sample notebook file already
    exists for the session.
