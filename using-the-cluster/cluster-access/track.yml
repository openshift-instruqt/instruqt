- assignment: 'The easiest way to access and interact with OpenShift is through the
    web console. The URL for the web console will be dictated by what was specified
    as the public URL for the OpenShift cluster when it was set up. Once the web console
    is accessed, how you then login will depend on the configured identity provider.


    For this course the public URL for the web console is:


    ``https://console-openshift-console-[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com``


    To view the web console at the same time as these instructions, you can also select
    the _Console_ tab to the right of the tab for the embedded _Terminal_.


    In the case of the OpenShift cluster managing user authentication, the web console
    login page will prompt you for your _Username_ and _Password_.


    ![Web Console Login](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/01-web-console-login.png)


    In the case of an external authentication service being used as the identity provider,
    it will be necessary to login first to the external service. As an example, if
    you were accessing [OpenShift Online](https://www.openshift.com/get-started/)
    you would see:


    ![External Login](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/01-external-identity-provider.png)


    For the OpenShift cluster used in this course, as the OpenShift cluster is managing
    user authentication, you will be presented with a login page that prompts you
    for your user account credentials. You can login using the credentials:


    * **Username:** ``developer``

    * **Password:** ``developer``


    As this is the first time you have logged in as this user in this OpenShift cluster,
    you will be presented with a "Welcome to OpenShift" message and the option of
    creating a new project.


    ![Web Console Welcome](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/01-web-console-welcome.png)


    Create a new project by selecting _Create Project_. Call the project ``myproject``.


    ![Create New Project](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/01-create-new-project.png)


    Upon creating a project you will be left on the overview page for the new project.


    If you want to get to a list of all the projects you have available, you can select
    "Home->Projects" from the left hand side menu. If you do not see the menu, you
    can click on the hamburger menu item button in the top level corner of the web
    console.

- assignment: "The OpenShift web console provides a convenient method for quickly\
    \ interacting with and viewing the state of applications you have deployed using\
    \ OpenShift. Not everything you may want to do can be done through the web console.\
    \ You will therefore also need to be familiar with using the OpenShift command\
    \ line tool ``oc``.\n\nIn this course the embedded _Terminal_ provided to you\
    \ already has ``oc`` installed so you do not need to download and install the\
    \ ``oc`` client.\n\nIf you were using a different OpenShift cluster and did not\
    \ already have the ``oc`` command line tool, you can download it by following\
    \ the links in the _Command Line Tools_ menu option of the web console.\n\n![Command\
    \ Line Tools](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/02-command-line-tools.png)\n\
    \nA link to details on where to get the command line tools was also shown on the\
    \ initial welcome page when you first accessed the cluster when there were no\
    \ projects.\n\nOnce you get to the list of downloads, you would need to download\
    \ the archive specific to your platform, extract the ``oc`` binary and install\
    \ it.\n\nTo login to the OpenShift cluster used for this course run in the terminal:\n\
    \n```\noc login -u developer -p developer\n```\n\nYou should see output similar\
    \ to:\n\n```\nAuthentication required for https://openshift:6443 (openshift)\n\
    Login successful.\n\nYou don't have any projects. You can try to create a new\
    \ project, by running\n\n    oc new-project <projectname>\n```\n\nNext, create\
    \ a new project namespace:\n\n```\noc new-project myproject\n```\n\nYou can list\
    \ all the projects you currently have access to by running:\n\n```\noc get projects\n\
    ```\n\nOnce logged in, you can verify what user you are logged in by running:\n\
    \n```\noc whoami\n```\n\nYou can verify which server you are logged into by running:\n\
    \n```\noc whoami --show-server\n```\n\nIn the case of an external authentication\
    \ service being used as the identity provider, the required steps are a bit different.\n\
    \nIf you login using ``oc login`` on the command line you will be presented with\
    \ an error message similar to:\n\n```\nLogin failed (401 Unauthorized)\nYou must\
    \ obtain an API token by visiting\n  https://api.starter-us-east-1.openshift.com/oauth/token/request\n\
    ```\n\nYou would visit the link given, logging in first via the separate authentication\
    \ service if necessary. You will then be redirected to a page which will give\
    \ details of the login command to use. This will include an access token to authenticate\
    \ you for the session.\n\nEven in the case where user authentication is managed\
    \ by the OpenShift cluster and user credentials are accepted, you can opt to instead\
    \ use an access token. You can retrieve the command to run by manually entering\
    \ the ``/oauth/token/request`` path against the URL for the cluster access endpoint.\n\
    \nIf you are already logged into the web console, you can also retrieve the details\
    \ of the login command and access token by accessing the _Copy Login Command_\
    \ menu option under your login name.\n\n ![Request Access Token](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/02-login-access-token.png)\n\
    \nWhichever mechanism you use to login from the command line using ``oc login``,\
    \ the login will periodically expire and you will need to login again. The expiration\
    \ period is typically 24 hours.\n"

  title: Topic 2 - Logging in Via the Command Line
  type: challenge
- assignment: 'Working alone can be lots of fun, but as your application grows you
    may want to get others to help. This is no problem with OpenShift as it is built
    to be multi tenant. This means it can support many different users, each working
    on their own applications. To support collaboration on the same project, you can
    also grant other users access to any of your projects. Access can be granted at
    varying levels depending on what they need to be able to do in your project.


    To test out how users can collaborate, we need another user.


    Login from the command line as the user ``user1`` by running:


    ```

    oc login --username user1 --password user1

    ```


    This is the first time this user has logged in, so if you run:


    ```

    oc get projects

    ```


    you should see that the user has access to no projects.


    To grant this user access to your project, go to the list of projects in the web
    console and select on the drop down menu to the right of the project name and
    select on _Edit Project_.


    ![Edit Project Details](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/03-edit-project-option.png)


    When the project details are displayed, select on the _Role Bindings_ tab.


    ![Project Role Bindings](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/03-project-role-bindings.png)


    You will see that only the ``developer`` user is a member of the project at this
    point, with the user having `admin` access.


    Click on _Create Binding_ to grant an additional user access to the project.


    ![Create Role Binding](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/03-create-role-binding.png)


    For the name of the role binding use ``user1-edit``.


    Ensure that the ``myproject`` namespace is selected, and with the role name as
    ``edit``.


    Finally enter ``user1`` as the subject name.


    Click on _Create_.


    The user ``user1`` is now a member of the project. Back in the _Terminal_ run
    again the command:


    ```

    oc get projects

    ```


    This should show that ``user1`` now has access to the project created by the ``developer``
    user.


    In this case you gave ``user1`` the role type ``edit`` in the project. This allows
    the user to perform most tasks within the project, with the exception of tasks
    related to administration of the project. The user therefore cannot make changes
    to project membership or delete the project.


    Other roles you might instead assign to a collaborator are ``view``, which means
    they can look at everything in the project, but not change anything, or ``admin``,
    which gives them equal rights as the owner of the project, including editing project
    membership or deleting the project.


    Making changes to project membership can also be done from the command line using
    ``oc``.


    As ``user1`` has no projects at this point, create one by running:


    ```

    oc new-project mysecrets

    ```


    Then add the ability for ``developer`` to also view that project by running:


    ```

    oc adm policy add-role-to-user view developer -n mysecrets

    ```


    Return to the main page in the web console where the list of projects is shown
    for ``developer`` and you should

    see ``mysecrets`` listed.

  title: Topic 3 - Collaborating with Other Users
  type: challenge
- assignment: 'When using the ``oc`` command line tool, you can only interact with
    one OpenShift cluster at a time. It is not possible to open a separate shell on
    the same computer, as the same local user, and work on a different OpenShift cluster
    at the same time. This is because state about the current login session is stored
    in the home directory of the local user running the ``oc`` command.


    If you do need to work against multiple OpenShift clusters, or even as different
    users on the same OpenShift cluster, you will need to remember to switch between
    them.


    In this course you originally logged in from the command line using ``oc login``
    as the ``developer`` user. You then subsequently logged in as the ``user1`` user.


    At this point you are still logged in and have an active session token for both
    users, but are currently operating as the ``user1`` user.


    To switch back to the ``developer`` user run:


    ```

    oc login --username developer

    ```


    Because you had already provided a password for the ``developer`` user, you will
    not be prompted to supply it again. The only time you would be prompted again
    to provide the password, or supply a new session token, when switching users,
    is if the active session had expired.


    You can validate that you are now the ``developer`` user by running:


    ```

    oc whoami

    ```


    If you are working against multiple OpenShift clusters, to switch between them,
    you again use ``oc login``, but supply just the URL for the OpenShift cluster.
    For example, if you had an account with the OpenShift Online free starter tier,
    and had been assigned to the ``us-east-1`` cluster, you could run:


    ``oc login https://api.starter-us-east-1.openshift.com``


    When switching between OpenShift clusters, if you do not explicitly say which
    user to use, it will use whatever was the last user you were logged in as with
    that cluster. You can still provide ``--username`` if required.


    Switching, without needing to supply the password or register with a token is
    possible as details for each are saved away separately in what is called a context.
    You can see what the current context is by running:


    ```

    oc whoami --show-context

    ```


    You can get a list of all OpenShift clusters you have ever logged into by running:


    ```

    oc config get-clusters

    ```


    You can get a list of all contexts which have ever been created, indicating what
    users on those clusters you have logged in as, and which projects you have worked
    on, by running:


    ```

    oc config get-contexts

    ```

description: '## Goal


  Learn how to log in to OpenShift with the web console and with the `oc` command
  line tool.


  ## Concepts


  * OpenShift user authentication and authorization basics

  * OpenShift Web Console

  * OpenShift `oc` tool

  * OpenShift Projects and collaboration


  ## Use case


  You must log in to do anything on an OpenShift cluster. To collaborate on an OpenShift
  Project, you can authorize other users to see or modify resources in your Projects.


  This OpenShift cluster will self-destruct in one hour.
