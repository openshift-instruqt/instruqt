    The easiest way to access and interact with OpenShift is through the web console. The URL for the web console will be dictated by what was specified as the public URL for the OpenShift cluster when it was set up. Once the web console is accessed, how you then login will depend on the configured identity provider.

    At first, check that the pod responsible for OpenShift Web Console to be ready:
    ```
    oc get pods -n openshift-console | grep console
    ```
    You might have to wait a minute for the pod to be ready.
    When the pod is ready, execute the following command to find the route to the OpenShift Web Console:
    ```
    oc get routes console -n openshift-console -o jsonpath='{"https://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
    ```
    Click or copy the link to access from your web browser.

    You will then be able to login with developer permissions with:
    * **Username:** ``developer``
    * **Password:** ``developer``
    ![Web Console Login](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/middleware/pipelines/web-console-login.png)

    As this is the first time you have logged in as this user in this OpenShift cluster, you will be presented with a "Welcome to OpenShift" message and the option of creating a new project.

    ![Web Console Welcome](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/01-web-console-welcome.png)

    Create a new project by selecting _Create Project_. Call the project ``myproject``.

    ![Create New Project](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/01-create-new-project.png)

    Upon creating a project you will be left on the overview page for the new project.

    If you want to get to a list of all the projects you have available, you can select "Home->Projects" from the left hand side menu. If you do not see the menu, you can click on the hamburger menu item button in the top level corner of the web console.

  title: Topic 2 - Logging in Via the Command Line
  assignment: |
    The OpenShift web console provides a convenient method for quickly interacting with and viewing the state of applications you have deployed using OpenShift. Not everything you may want to do can be done through the web console. You will therefore also need to be familiar with using the OpenShift command line tool ``oc``.

    In this course the embedded _Terminal_ provided to you already has ``oc`` installed so you do not need to download and install the ``oc`` client.

    If you were using a different OpenShift cluster and did not already have the ``oc`` command line tool, you can download it by following the links in the _Command Line Tools_ menu option of the web console.

    ![Command Line Tools](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/02-command-line-tools.png)

    A link to details on where to get the command line tools was also shown on the initial welcome page when you first accessed the cluster when there were no projects.

    Once you get to the list of downloads, you would need to download the archive specific to your platform, extract the ``oc`` binary and install it.

    To login to the OpenShift cluster used for this course run in the terminal:

    ```
    oc login -u developer -p developer
    ```

    You should see output similar to:

    ```
    Authentication required for https://openshift:6443 (openshift)
    Login successful.

    You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

        oc new-project <projectname>
    ```

    Next, use the project namespace you created in the previous step:

    ```
    oc project myproject
    ```

    You can list all the projects you currently have access to by running:

    ```
    oc get projects
    ```

    Once logged in, you can verify what user you are logged in by running:

    ```
    oc whoami
    ```

    You can verify which server you are logged into by running:

    ```
    oc whoami --show-server
    ```

    In the case of an external authentication service being used as the identity provider, the required steps are a bit different.

    If you login using ``oc login`` on the command line you will be presented with an error message similar to:

    ```
    Login failed (401 Unauthorized)
    You must obtain an API token by visiting
      https://api.starter-us-east-1.openshift.com/oauth/token/request
    ```

    You would visit the link given, logging in first via the separate authentication service if necessary. You will then be redirected to a page which will give details of the login command to use. This will include an access token to authenticate you for the session.

    Even in the case where user authentication is managed by the OpenShift cluster and user credentials are accepted, you can opt to instead use an access token. You can retrieve the command to run by manually entering the ``/oauth/token/request`` path against the URL for the cluster access endpoint.

    If you are already logged into the web console, you can also retrieve the details of the login command and access token by accessing the _Copy Login Command_ menu option under your login name.

     ![Request Access Token](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/02-login-access-token.png)

    Whichever mechanism you use to login from the command line using ``oc login``, the login will periodically expire and you will need to login again. The expiration period is typically 24 hours.

  title: Topic 3 - Collaborating with Other Users
  assignment: |
    Working alone can be lots of fun, but as your application grows you may want to get others to help. This is no problem with OpenShift as it is built to be multi tenant. This means it can support many different users, each working on their own applications. To support collaboration on the same project, you can also grant other users access to any of your projects. Access can be granted at varying levels depending on what they need to be able to do in your project.

    To test out how users can collaborate, we need another user.

    Login from the command line as the user ``user1`` by running:

    ```
    oc login --username user1 --password user1
    ```

    This is the first time this user has logged in, so if you run:

    ```
    oc get projects
    ```

    you should see that the user has access to no projects.

    To grant this user access to your project, go to the list of projects in the web console and select on the drop down menu to the right of the project name and select on _Edit Project_.

    ![Edit Project Details](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/03-edit-project-option.png)

    When the project details are displayed, select on the _Role Bindings_ tab.

    ![Project Role Bindings](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/03-project-role-bindings.png)

    You will see that only the ``developer`` user is a member of the project at this point, with the user having `admin` access.

    Click on _Create Binding_ to grant an additional user access to the project.

    ![Create Role Binding](https://katacoda.com/openshift/assets/introduction/cluster-access-44/03-create-role-binding.png)

    For the name of the role binding use ``user1-edit``.

    Ensure that the ``myproject`` namespace is selected, and with the role name as ``edit``.

    Finally enter ``user1`` as the subject name.

    Click on _Create_.

    The user ``user1`` is now a member of the project. Back in the _Terminal_ run again the command:

    ```
    oc get projects
    ```

    This should show that ``user1`` now has access to the project created by the ``developer`` user.

    In this case you gave ``user1`` the role type ``edit`` in the project. This allows the user to perform most tasks within the project, with the exception of tasks related to administration of the project. The user therefore cannot make changes to project membership or delete the project.

    Other roles you might instead assign to a collaborator are ``view``, which means they can look at everything in the project, but not change anything, or ``admin``, which gives them equal rights as the owner of the project, including editing project membership or deleting the project.

    Making changes to project membership can also be done from the command line using ``oc``.

    As ``user1`` has no projects at this point, create one by running:

    ```
    oc new-project mysecrets
    ```

    Then add the ability for ``developer`` to also view that project by running:

    ```
    oc adm policy add-role-to-user view developer -n mysecrets
    ```

    Return to the main page in the web console where the list of projects is shown for ``developer`` and you should
    see ``mysecrets`` listed.

  title: Topic 4 - Switching Between Accounts
  assignment: |
    When using the ``oc`` command line tool, you can only interact with one OpenShift cluster at a time. It is not possible to open a separate shell on the same computer, as the same local user, and work on a different OpenShift cluster at the same time. This is because state about the current login session is stored in the home directory of the local user running the ``oc`` command.

    If you do need to work against multiple OpenShift clusters, or even as different users on the same OpenShift cluster, you will need to remember to switch between them.

    In this course you originally logged in from the command line using ``oc login`` as the ``developer`` user. You then subsequently logged in as the ``user1`` user.

    At this point you are still logged in and have an active session token for both users, but are currently operating as the ``user1`` user.

    To switch back to the ``developer`` user run:

    ```
    oc login --username developer
    ```

    Because you had already provided a password for the ``developer`` user, you will not be prompted to supply it again. The only time you would be prompted again to provide the password, or supply a new session token, when switching users, is if the active session had expired.

    You can validate that you are now the ``developer`` user by running:

    ```
    oc whoami
    ```

    If you are working against multiple OpenShift clusters, to switch between them, you again use ``oc login``, but supply just the URL for the OpenShift cluster. For example, if you had an account with the [Developer Sandbox for OpenShift](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox), you could run something similar:

    `oc login --token=<token> --server=https://api.sandbox-m2.ll9k.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443`

    When switching between OpenShift clusters, if you do not explicitly say which user to use, it will use whatever was the last user you were logged in as with that cluster. You can still provide ``--username`` if required.

    Switching, without needing to supply the password or register with a token is possible as details for each are saved away separately in what is called a context. You can see what the current context is by running:

    ```
    oc whoami --show-context
    ```

    You can get a list of all OpenShift clusters you have ever logged into by running:

    ```
    oc config get-clusters
    ```

    You can get a list of all contexts which have ever been created, indicating what users on those clusters you have logged in as, and which projects you have worked on, by running:

    ```
    oc config get-contexts
    ```
