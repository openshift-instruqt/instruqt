title: Transferring Files in and out of Containers
description: |
  ## Goal

  The goal of this track is to demonstrate how to copy files to and from a running container without rebuilding the container image. In addition, the track will demonstrate how to use a Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume claim under OpenShift to store data independent of a container.

  |What you need to know before you start|
  |----|
  |In order to get full benefit from taking this track you should...<br>• Be comfortable working at the command line in a terminal window.<br>• Have a general understanding about the purpose and use of [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform) as a management framework for Linux containers.<br>• Know how to use the [`oc`](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) CLI to work with OpenShift at the command line.|


  ## Concepts and techniques you'll cover

  * Creating OpenShift projects and applications from the command line using the `oc` command
  * Copying files from a container and into a local machine using the `oc resync` command
  * Using the implicit automation available in OpenShift to copy changed files on a local machine to a container's file system.
  * Work with a Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume claim independent of a container

  ## Use case

  You use the concepts and techniques covered in this track when you want to manually or automatically synchronize changes in the files on a local machine with containers in an OpenShift cluster and vice versa.
