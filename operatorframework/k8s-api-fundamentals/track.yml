title: Kubernetes API Fundamentals
description: Before diving into the [Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework), this section will give an overview of Kubernetes API fundamentals.  Although the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) makes creating an Operator fun and easy, understanding the structure and features of the Kubernetes API is required.

  title: Kubernetes Manifests
  assignment: |-
    Let's begin by creating a new project called `myproject`:

    ```
    oc new-project myproject
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Create a new pod manifest that specifies two containers:

    ```
    cat > pod-multi-container.yaml <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-two-container-pod
      namespace: myproject
      labels:
        environment: dev
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: server
          image: nginx:1.13-alpine
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
        - name: side-car
          image: alpine:latest
          command: ["/usr/bin/tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
      restartPolicy: Never
    EOF
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Create the pod by specifying the manifest:

    ```
    oc create -f pod-multi-container.yaml
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    View the detail for the pod and look at the events:

    ```
    oc describe pod my-two-container-pod
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Let's first execute a shell session inside the server container by using the
    `-c` flag:

    ```
    oc exec -it my-two-container-pod -c server -- /bin/sh
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Run some commands inside the server container:

    ```
    ip address
    netstat -ntlp
    hostname
    ps
    exit
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Let's now execute a shell session inside the side-car container:

    ```
    oc exec -it my-two-container-pod -c side-car -- /bin/sh
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Run the same commands in side-car container. Each container within a pod runs
    it's own cgroup, but shares IPC, Network, and UTC (hostname) namespaces:

    ```
    ip address
    netstat -ntlp
    hostname
    exit
    ```
    `
    ```

  title: Basic Operations with the Kubernetes API
  assignment: |
    Verify the currently available Kubernetes API versions:

    ```
    oc api-versions
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Use the `--v` flag to set a verbosity level. This will allow you to see the request/responses against the Kubernetes API:

    ```
    oc get pods --v=8
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Use the `oc proxy` command to proxy local requests on port 8001 to the Kubernetes API:

    ```
    oc proxy --port=8001
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Open up another terminal by clicking the **+** button and select `Open New Terminal`.
    <br>
    <br>
    Send a `GET` request to the Kubernetes API using `curl`:

    ```
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8001
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    We can explore the OpenAPI definition file to see complete API details.

    ```
    curl localhost:8001/openapi/v2
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Send a `GET` request to list all pods in the environment:

    ```
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/api/v1/pods
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Use `jq` to parse the json response:

    ```
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/api/v1/pods | jq .items[].metadata.name
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    We can scope the response by only viewing all pods in a particular namespace:

    ```
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/myproject/pods
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Get more details on a particular pod within the `myproject` namespace:

    ```
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/myproject/pods/my-two-container-pod
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Export the manifest associated with `my-two-container-pod` in json format:

    ```
    oc get pods my-two-container-pod --export -o json > podmanifest.json
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Within the manifest, replace the `1.13` version of alpine with `1.14`:

    ```
    sed -i 's|nginx:1.13-alpine|nginx:1.14-alpine|g' podmanifest.json
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Update/Replace the current pod manifest with the newly updated manifest:

    ```
    curl -X PUT http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/myproject/pods/my-two-container-pod -H "Content-type: application/json" -d @podmanifest.json
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Patch the current pod with a newer container image (`1.15`):

    ```
    curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/myproject/pods/my-two-container-pod -H "Content-type: application/strategic-merge-patch+json" -d '{"spec":{"containers":[{"name": "server","image":"nginx:1.15-alpine"}]}}'
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Delete the current pod by sending the `DELETE` request method:

    ```
    curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/myproject/pods/my-two-container-pod
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Verify the pod is in `Terminating` status:

    ```
    oc get pods
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Verify the pod no longer exists:

    ```
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/myproject/pods/my-two-container-pod
    ```
    `
    ```

  title: Replica Sets
  assignment: |
    Get a list of all pods in the `myproject` Namespace:

    ```
    oc get pods -n myproject
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Create a ReplicaSet object manifest file:

    ```
    cat > replica-set.yaml <<EOF
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: ReplicaSet
    metadata:
      name: myfirstreplicaset
      namespace: myproject
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
         app: myfirstapp
      replicas: 3
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: myfirstapp
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: nodejs
              image: openshiftkatacoda/blog-django-py
    EOF
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Create the ReplicaSet:

    ```
    oc apply -f replica-set.yaml
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    In a new terminal window, select all pods that match `app=myfirstapp`:

    ```
    oc get pods -l app=myfirstapp --show-labels -w
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Delete the pods and watch new ones spawn:

    ```
    oc delete pod -l app=myfirstapp
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Imperatively scale the ReplicaSet to 6 replicas:

    ```
    oc scale replicaset myfirstreplicaset --replicas=6
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Imperatively scale down the ReplicaSet to 3 replicas:

    ```
    oc scale replicaset myfirstreplicaset --replicas=3
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    The `oc scale` command interacts with the `/scale` endpoint:

    ```
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/myproject/replicasets/myfirstreplicaset/scale
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Use the `PUT` method against the `/scale` endpoint to change the number of replicas to 5:

    ```
    curl  -X PUT localhost:8001/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/myproject/replicasets/myfirstreplicaset/scale -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"kind":"Scale","apiVersion":"autoscaling/v1","metadata":{"name":"myfirstreplicaset","namespace":"myproject"},"spec":{"replicas":5}}'
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    You can also get information regarding the pod by using the `GET` method against the `/status` endpoint

    ```
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/apis/apps/v1/namespaces/myproject/replicasets/myfirstreplicaset/status
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    The status endpoint's primary purpose is to allow a controller (with proper RBAC permissions) to send a `PUT` method along with the desired status.

  title: Deployments/Finalizers
  assignment: |
    Create a manifest for a Deployment with a Finalizer:

    ```
    cat > finalizer-test.yaml<<EOF
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: finalizer-test
      namespace: myproject
      labels:
        app: finalizer-test
      finalizers:
        - finalizer.extensions/v1beta1
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: finalizer-test
      replicas: 3
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: finalizer-test
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: hieveryone
              image: openshiftkatacoda/blog-django-py
              imagePullPolicy: Always
              ports:
                - name: helloworldport
                  containerPort: 8080
    EOF
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Create the Deployment.

    ```
    oc create -f finalizer-test.yaml
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Verify the Deployment has been created.

    ```
    oc get deploy
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Verify the ReplicaSet has been created:

    ```
    oc get replicaset
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Verify the pods are running:

    ```
    oc get pods
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Attempt to delete the Deployment.

    ```
    oc delete deployment finalizer-test
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Open up another terminal by clicking the **+** button and select `Open New Terminal`.
    <br>
    <br>
    Observe the Deployment still exits and has been updated with the `deletionGracePeriodSeconds` and `deletionTimestamp` fields.

    ```
    oc get deployment finalizer-test -o yaml | grep 'deletionGracePeriodSeconds\|deletionTimestamp'
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Attempt to scale the Deployment up and down. Although status is updated, pods will not be created/deleted:

    ```
    oc scale deploy finalizer-test --replicas=5
    oc scale deploy finalizer-test --replicas=1
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>

    ```
    oc get deploy
    oc get pods
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>

    Update the Deployment with the Finalizer value unset.

    ```
    cat > finalizer-test-remove.yaml<<EOF
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: finalizer-test
      namespace: myproject
      labels:
        app: finalizer-test
      finalizers:
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: finalizer-test
      replicas: 3
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: finalizer-test
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: hieveryone
              image: openshiftkatacoda/blog-django-py
              imagePullPolicy: Always
              ports:
                - name: helloworldport
                  containerPort: 8080
    EOF
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Replace the Deployment.

    ```
    oc replace -f finalizer-test-remove.yaml
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    The Deployment will now be deleted.

    ```
    oc get deploy
    oc get pods
    ```
    `
    ```

  title: Custom Resource Definitions
  assignment: |-
    Begin by running a proxy to the Kubernetes API server:

    ```
    oc proxy --port=8001
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Open up another terminal by clicking the **+** button and select `Open New Terminal`.
    <br>
    <br>

    Let's create a new Custom Resource Definition (CRD) object manifest for Postgres:

    ```
    cat >> postgres-crd.yaml <<EOF
    apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
    kind: CustomResourceDefinition
    metadata:
      name: postgreses.rd.example.com
    spec:
      group: rd.example.com
      names:
        kind: Postgres
        listKind: PostgresList
        plural: postgreses
        singular: postgres
        shortNames:
        - pg
      scope: Namespaced
      versions:
      - name: v1alpha1
        schema:
          openAPIV3Schema:
            type: object
            x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true
        served: true
        storage: true
    EOF
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Create the ***CRD*** resource object:

    ```
    oc create -f postgres-crd.yaml
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    You should now see the Kubernetes API reflect a brand new *api group* called **rd.example.com**:

    ```
    curl http://localhost:8001/apis | jq .groups[].name
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    This will also be reflected in the `oc api-versions` command:

    ```
    oc api-versions
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Within the `rd.example.com` group there will be an *api version* **v1alpha1** (per our CRD resource object). The database resource resides here.

    ```
    curl http://localhost:8001/apis/rd.example.com/v1alpha1 | jq
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Notice how `oc` now recognize postgres as a present resource (although there will be no current resource objects at this time).

    ```
    oc get postgres
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Let's create a new Custom Resource (CR) object manifest for the database:

    ```
    cat >> wordpress-database.yaml <<EOF
    apiVersion: "rd.example.com/v1alpha1"
    kind: Postgres
    metadata:
      name: wordpressdb
    spec:
      user: postgres
      password: postgres
      database: primarydb
      nodes: 3
    EOF
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Create the new object:

    ```
    oc create -f wordpress-database.yaml
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Verify the resource was created:

    ```
    oc get postgres
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    View the details about the wordpressdb object:

    ```
    oc get postgres wordpressdb -o yaml
    ```
    `
    ```
