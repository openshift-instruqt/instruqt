  assignment: |
    Let's begin by creating a new project called `myproject`:

    ```
    cd /root && \
    oc new-project myproject
    ```

    Create the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for the Etcd Operator:

    ```
    cat > etcd-operator-crd.yaml<<EOF
    apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
    kind: CustomResourceDefinition
    metadata:
      name: etcdclusters.etcd.database.coreos.com
    spec:
      group: etcd.database.coreos.com
      names:
        kind: EtcdCluster
        listKind: EtcdClusterList
        plural: etcdclusters
        shortNames:
        - etcdclus
        - etcd
        singular: etcdcluster
      scope: Namespaced
      version: v1beta2
      versions:
      - name: v1beta2
        schema:
          openAPIV3Schema:

            x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true
        served: true
        storage: true
    EOF
    ```

    ```
    oc create -f etcd-operator-crd.yaml
    ```

    Verify the CRD was successfully created.

    ```
    oc get crd etcdclusters.etcd.database.coreos.com

  title: Creating the Service Account, Role, and RoleBinding
  assignment: |-
    Create a dedicated Service Account responsible for running the Etcd Operator:

    ```
    cd /root && \
    cat > etcd-operator-sa.yaml<<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: etcd-operator-sa
    EOF
    ```

    ```
    oc create -f etcd-operator-sa.yaml
    ```

    Verify the Service Account was successfully created:

    ```
    oc get sa
    ```

    Create the Role that the `etcd-operator-sa` Service Account will need for authorization to perform actions against the Kubernetes API:

    ```
    cat > etcd-operator-role.yaml<<EOF
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      name: etcd-operator-role
    rules:
    - apiGroups:
      - etcd.database.coreos.com
      resources:
      - etcdclusters
      - etcdbackups
      - etcdrestores
      verbs:
      - '*'

      verbs:
      - get
    EOF
    ```

    ```
    oc create -f etcd-operator-role.yaml
    ```

    Verify the Role was successfully created:

    ```
    oc get roles
    ```

    Create the RoleBinding to bind the `etcd-operator-role` Role to the `etcd-operator-sa` Service Account:

    ```
    cat > etcd-operator-rolebinding.yaml<<EOF
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: etcd-operator-rolebinding
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: Role
      name: etcd-operator-role
    subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: etcd-operator-sa
      namespace: myproject
    EOF
    ```

    ```
    oc create -f etcd-operator-rolebinding.yaml
    ```

    Verify the RoleBinding was successfully created:

    ```
    oc get rolebindings
    ```

    Create the Deployment containing the Etcd Operator container image:

    EOF
    ```

    ```
    oc create -f etcd-operator-deployment.yaml
    ```

    Verify the Etcd Operator Deployment was successfully created:

    ```
    oc get deploy
    ```

    Verify the Etcd Operator Deployment pods are running:

    ```
    oc get pods
    ```

    From *Terminal 2* follow Etcd Operator logs in real-time:

    ```
    export ETCD_OPERATOR_POD=$(oc get pods -l name=etcd-operator -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
    oc logs $ETCD_OPERATOR_POD -f
    ```

    Observe the leader-election lease on the Etcd Operator Endpoint:

    ```
    oc get endpoints etcd-operator -o yaml
    ```

  title: Creating the EtcdCluster Custom Resource (CR)
  assignment: |
    Ensure you are currently scoped to the `myproject` Namespace:

    ```
    cd /root && \
      oc project myproject
    ```

    Create an Etcd cluster by referring to the new Custom Resource, `EtcdCluster`, defined in the Custom Resource Definition on Step 1:

    ```
    cat > etcd-operator-cr.yaml<<EOF
    apiVersion: etcd.database.coreos.com/v1beta2
    kind: EtcdCluster
    metadata:
      name: example-etcd-cluster
    spec:
      size: 3
      version: 3.1.10
    EOF
    ```

    ```
    oc create -f etcd-operator-cr.yaml
    ```

    Patch the just created resource:

    ```
    oc patch service example-etcd-cluster --type='json' -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/publishNotReadyAddresses", "value":true}]'
    ```

    Verify the cluster object was created:

    ```
    oc get etcdclusters
    ```

    Watch the pods in the Etcd cluster get created:

    ```
    oc get pods -l etcd_cluster=example-etcd-cluster -w
    ```

    Verify the cluster has been exposed via a ClusterIP service:

    ```
    oc get services -l etcd_cluster=example-etcd-cluster
    ```

  title: Interacting with a Live Etcd Cluster
  assignment: |
    Let's now create another pod and attempt to connect to the etcd cluster via `etcdctl`:

    ```
    oc run etcdclient --image=busybox busybox --restart=Never -- /usr/bin/tail -f /dev/null
    ```

    Access the pod:

    ```
    oc rsh etcdclient
    ```


    Install the Etcd Client:

    ```
    wget https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v3.1.4/etcd-v3.1.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    tar -xvf etcd-v3.1.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    cp etcd-v3.1.4-linux-amd64/etcdctl .
    ```

    Set the etcd version and endpoint variables:

    ```
    export ETCDCTL_API=3
    export ETCDCTL_ENDPOINTS=example-etcd-cluster-client:2379
    ```

    Attempt to write a key/value into the Etcd cluster:

    ```
    ./etcdctl put operator sdk
    ./etcdctl get operator
    ```

    Exit out of the client pod:

    ```
    exit
    ```

  title: Scaling and Modifying the Etcd Version
  assignment: |
    Let's change the size of the Etcd `example-etcd-cluster` CR. The Etcd Operator pod will detect the CR `spec.size` change and modify the number of pods in the cluster:

    ```
    oc patch etcdcluster example-etcd-cluster --type='json' -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/size", "value":5}]'
    ```


    Let's change the version of our `example-etcd-cluster` CR. The etcd-operator pod will detect the CR `spec.version` change and create a new cluster with the newly specified image:

    ```
    oc patch etcdcluster example-etcd-cluster --type='json' -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/version", "value":3.2.13}]'
