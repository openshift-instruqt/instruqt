title: Operator SDK with Helm, Memcached
description: |-
  In the previous learning modules, we covered how to easily create the following types of Operators with the Operator SDK:

  * **Go**:
  Ideal for traditional software development teams that want to get to a fully auto-pilot Operator. It gives you the ability to leverage the same Kubernetes libraries the upstream projects uses under the hood. Check out the [Go Getting Started guide](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/).

  * **Ansible**:
  Useful for infrastructure-focused teams that have investment in Ansible modules but want to use them in a Kubernetes-native way. Also great for using Ansible to configure off-cluster objects like hardware load balancers. Check out the [Ansible Getting Started guide](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/ansible/).

  We will now focus on the easiest way to get started developing an Operator:

  * **Helm**:
  Useful for securely running Helm charts without [Tiller](https://helm.sh/docs/glossary/#tiller) and  it doesn’t rely on manual invocation of Helm to reconfigure your apps. Check out the [Helm Operator Getting Started guide](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/helm/) for more information.

  ## Creating a Memcached Operator from a Helm Chart

  In this tutorial, we will create a Memcached Operator from an existing [Memcached Helm Chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/memcached/Chart.yaml).

  [Memcached](https://memcached.org/) is a Free & open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.

  title: Initialize the Project
  assignment: |
    Let's begin my creating a new project called `myproject`:

    ```
    oc new-project myproject
    ```
    `
    ```

    Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering.


    Let's now create a new directory for our project:

    ```
    mkdir -p $HOME/projects/memcached-operator
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Navigate to the directory:

    ```
    cd $HOME/projects/memcached-operator
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Create a new Helm-based Operator SDK project for the Memcached Operator:

    ```
    operator-sdk init --plugins helm --domain example.com
    ```
    `
    ```

    <br>
    For Helm-based projects, `operator-sdk` init also generates the RBAC rules in `config/rbac/role.yaml` based on the resources that would be deployed by the chart’s default manifest. Be sure to double check that the rules generated in `config/rbac/role.yaml` meet the operator’s permission requirements.

    To learn more about the project directory structure, see the [project layout](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/overview/project-layout) doc.

    ** Use an existing chart **

    Instead of creating your project with a boilerplate Helm chart, you can also use `--helm-chart`, `--helm-chart-repo`, and `--helm-chart-version` to use an existing chart, either from your local filesystem or a remote chart repository.

    <br>
    Automatically fetch the Memcached Helm Chart and generate the CRD/API:

    ```
    operator-sdk create api --helm-chart memcached --helm-chart-repo=https://charts.helm.sh/stable
    ```
    <br>
    ### Project Scaffolding Layout

    After creating a new operator project the directory has numerous generated folders and files. The following
    table describes a basic rundown of each generated file/directory.

    | File/Folders   | Purpose                           |
    | :---           | :--- |
    | config | Kustomize YAML definitions required to launch our controller on a cluster. It is the target directory to hold our CustomResourceDefinitions, RBAC configuration, and WebhookConfigurations.
    | Dockerfile | The container build file used to build your Ansible Operator container image. |
    | helm-charts | The location for the specified helm-charts. |
    | Makefile | Make targets for building and deploying your controller. |
    | PROJECT | Kubebuilder metadata for scaffolding new components. |
    | watches.yaml | Contains Group, Version, Kind, and desired chart. |

  title: Apply the Memcached Custom Resource Definition
  assignment: |
    Apply the Memcached Custom Resource Definition to the cluster:

    ```
    oc apply -f config/crd/bases/charts.example.com_memcacheds.yaml
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Once the CRD is registered, there are two ways to run the Operator:

    * As a Pod inside a Kubernetes cluster
    * As a Go program outside the cluster using Operator-SDK. This is great for local development of your Operator.

    For the sake of this tutorial, we will run the Operator as a Go program outside the cluster using Operator-SDK and our `kubeconfig` credentials

    Once running, the command will block the current session. You can continue interacting with the OpenShift cluster by opening a new terminal window. You can quit the session by pressing `CTRL + C`.

    ```
    WATCH_NAMESPACE=myproject make run
    ```
    `

  title: Apply the Memcached Custom Resource
  assignment: |
    Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `memcached-operator` top-level directory:

    ```
    cd projects/memcached-operator
    ```
    `
    ```
    Before applying the Memcached Custom Resource, observe the Memcached Helm Chart `values.yaml`:

    [Memcached Helm Chart Values.yaml file](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/memcached/values.yaml)

    Update the Memcached Custom Resource at `config/samples/charts_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml` with the following values:

    * `spec.replicaCount: 3`

    <pre class="file">
    apiVersion: charts.example.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Memcached
    metadata:
      name: memcached-sample
    spec:

      affinity: {}

      memcached:

        resources: {}
        serviceMonitor:
          enabled: false
          interval: 15s
      nodeSelector: {}
      pdbMinAvailable: 2
      podAnnotations: {}
      replicaCount: 3

          memory: 64Mi
      securityContext:

        fsGroup: 1001
        runAsUser: 1001
      serviceAnnotations: {}
      tolerations: {}
      updateStrategy:
        type: RollingUpdate
    </pre>

    You can easily update this file by running the following command:

    ```
    \cp /tmp/charts_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml config/samples/charts_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    After updating the Memcached Custom Resource with our desired spec, apply it to the cluster. Ensure you are currently scoped to the `myproject` Namespace:

    ```
    oc project myproject
    ```
    `
    ```

    ```
    oc apply -f config/samples/charts_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Confirm that the Custom Resource was created:

    ```
    oc get memcached
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    It may take some time for the environment to pull down the Memcached container image. Confirm that the Stateful Set was created:

    ```
    oc get statefulset
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Confirm that the Stateful Set's pod is currently running:

    ```
    oc get pods
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Confirm that the Memcached "internal" and "public" ClusterIP Service were created:

    ```
    oc get services
    ```
    `
    ```

    oc patch memcached memcached-sample -p '{"spec":{"replicaCount": 5}}' --type=merge
    ```
    `
    ```

    <br>
    Verify that the Memcached Stateful Set is creating two additional pods:

    ```
    oc get pods
    ```
    `

  title: Test Memcached Cluster Failover
  assignment: |
    If any Memcached member fails it gets restarted or recreated automatically by the Kubernetes infrastructure, and will rejoin the cluster automatically when it comes back up. You can test this scenario by killing any of the pods:

    ```
    oc delete pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=memcached
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Watch the pods respawn:

    ```
    oc get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=memcached
    ```

    Verify that the Stateful Set, pods, and services are removed:
