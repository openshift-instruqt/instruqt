    ## Why an Operator?

    Operators make it easy to manage complex stateful applications on top of Kubernetes. However writing an operator today can be difficult because of challenges such as using low level APIs, writing boilerplate, and a lack of modularity which leads to duplication.

    The Operator SDK is a framework that uses the controller-runtime library to make writing operators easier by providing:

    * High level APIs and abstractions to write the operational logic more intuitively
    * Tools for scaffolding and code generation to bootstrap a new project fast
    * Extensions to cover common operator use cases

    ## What is an Ansible Operator?

    A collection of building blocks from Operator SDK that enables Ansible to handle the reconciliation logic for an Operator.

    ## Included in Operator Framework

    Ansible Operator is one of the available types of Operators that Operator SDK is able to generate. Operator SDK can create an operator using Golang, Helm, or Ansible.

    ## How do I use it?

    Build your Ansible code on top of a provided base image along with some metadata to map Kubernetes events to Ansible Playbooks or Roles.

    ![Ansible Operator Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-labs/learn-katacoda/master/ansibleop/ansible-operator-overview/assets/images/ansible-op-flow.png)

    The following workflow is for a new **Ansible** operator:

    1. Create a new Operator project using the Operator SDK Command Line Interface (CLI)
    2. Write the reconciling logic for your object using Ansible Playbooks and Roles
    3. Use the SDK CLI to build and generate the operator deployment manifests
    4. Optionally add additional CRD's using the SDK CLI and repeat steps 2 and 3

    Now, let's dig into the specifics and walk through an example.

  title: The role of the Watches File
  assignment: |
    ***

    *This step doesn't require changes to the interactive environment, but feel free to explore.*

    ***

    Now that we have demonstrated the Ansible k8s modules, we want to trigger this Ansible logic when a *Custom Resource* changes. The Ansible Operator uses a *Watches file*, written in YAML, which holds the mapping between Custom Resources and Ansible Roles/Playbooks.

    **NOTE**: It is incredibly important that the Ansible Roles/Playbooks packaged into an Ansible Operator are **[idempotent](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html#term-idempotency)**, as these tasks will be executed frequently to ensure the application is in its proper state.

    ## Structure of a *Watches file*

    The **Watches file** maps Custom Resources (identified by Group, Version, and Kind [GVK]) to Ansible Roles and Playbooks. The Operator expects this mapping file in a predefined location: `/opt/ansible/watches.yaml`

    Each mapping within the Watches file has mandatory fields:

    * **group**: Group of the Custom Resource that you will be watching.

    * **version**: Version of the Custom Resource that you will be watching.

    * **kind**: Kind of the Custom Resource that you will be watching.

    * **role** (_default_): Path to the Role that should be run by the Operator for a particular Group-Version-Kind (GVK). This field is mutually exclusive with the "playbook" field.

    * **playbook** (_optional_): Path to the Playbook that should be run by the Operator for a particular Group-Version-Kind (GVK). A Playbook can be used to invoke multiple Roles. This field is mutually exclusive with the "role" field.

    __Sample watches.yaml__

    ```yaml
    ---
    - version: v1alpha1
      group: foo.example.com
      kind: Foo
      # associates GVK with Role
      role: /opt/ansible/roles/Foo

    ```

    By default, `operator-sdk new --type ansible` creates 'watches.yaml' configured to *execute a role* in response to a *Custom Resource* event.

    This works well for smaller projects, but for more complex Ansible we might not want all of our logic in a single role.

    ## Triggering a Playbook instead of a Role

    Configuring the *Watches file* to run a Playbook allows the developer more flexibility in consuming other Ansible roles and enabling more customized application deployments.

    To use a Playbook in your operator, you would modify `watches.yaml` as shown below:

    ```yaml
    ---
    - version: v1alpha1
      group: foo.example.com
      kind: Foo
      # associating a Custom Resource GVK with a Playbook
      playbook: /opt/ansible/playbook.yaml

    ```

    For this to work, we would need to copy `playbook.yaml` into the container image.

    You would accomplish this by modifying the Operator Dockerfile to *COPY* 'playbook.yaml' into the container as shown below:

    ```
    # Dockerfile at <project-name>/build/Dockerfile

    FROM quay.io/operator-framework/ansible-operator

    COPY roles/ ${HOME}/roles
    COPY watches.yaml ${HOME}/watches.yaml

    # New 'COPY' build step for playbook.yaml
    COPY playbook.yaml ${HOME}/playbook.yaml

    ```

    ## Preconfiguration for a Playbook

    If you know from the start that you want your Operator to use a Playbook instead of a Role, you can generate your project scaffolding with the `--generate-playbook` flag:

    ```
    operator-sdk init --plugins=ansible --domain example.com
    operator-sdk create api --group cache --version v1alpha1 --kind Memcached --generate-playbook
    ```

  title: The Custom Resource File
  assignment: |
    ***

    _This step doesn't require changes to the interactive environment, but feel free to explore._

    ***

    Using Ansible Operator, a *change in the state* of a Custom Resource (CR) signals to the Operator that certain Playbooks/Roles should be executed. So what does a Custom Resource look like?

    As a creator/user of an Ansible Operator, you'll create CRs to test that your Operator has the expected response to each CR trigger.

    ## Structure of a Custom Resource

    The Custom Resource takes the format of a Kubernetes resource. The object definition has _mandatory_ fields:

    ### Mandatory Fields

    * **apiVersion**: Version of the Custom Resource that will be created

    * **kind**: Kind of the Custom Resource that will be created

    * **metadata**: Kubernetes metadata that will be created

    * **spec**: Key-value list of variables which are passed to Ansible. *Optional* and will be empty by default.

    * **annotations**: Kubernetes annotations to be appended to the CR. See the below section for Ansible Operator specific annotations.

    ### Annotations
    Custom Resource annotations can be applied to modify Ansible Operator behavior:

    * **ansible.operator-sdk/reconcile-period**: Used to specify the reconciliation interval for the CR.
      * This value is parsed using the standard [Golang 'Package time'](https://golang.org/pkg/time/). Specifically, ParseDuration is used which will use the default of an 's' suffix giving the value in seconds (e.g. "30" would become "30s" as shown below).

    ## Custom Resource Example
    If an Ansible Operator was watching for events from `kind: Foo` with `apiVersion: foo.example.com/v1alpha1`, an Ansible Playbook/Role could be triggered in response to creation of the resource shown below.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: "foo.example.com/v1alpha1"
    kind: "Foo"
    metadata:
      name: "example"
    annotations:
      ansible.operator-sdk/reconcile-period: "30s"
    ```

    type: terminal

  type: challenge
  title: Handle Extra Vars
  assignment: |
    ***

    _This step doesn't require changes to the interactive environment, but feel free to explore._

    ***

    To pass 'extra vars' to the Playbooks/Roles being run by the Operator, you can embed key-value pairs in the 'spec' section of the *Custom Resource (CR)*.

    This is equivalent to how [*--extra-vars*](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#passing-variables-on-the-command-line) can be passed into the  _ansible-playbook_ command.

    ## Example CR with extra-vars

    The CR snippet below shows two 'extra vars' (`message` and `newParamater`) being passed in via `spec`. Passing 'extra vars' through the CR allows for customization of Ansible logic based on the contents of each CR instance.
    ```yaml
    # Sample CR definition where some
    # 'extra vars' are passed via the spec
    apiVersion: "app.example.com/v1alpha1"
    kind: "Database"
    metadata:
      name: "example"
    spec:
      message: "Hello world 2"
      newParameter: "newParam"

    ```


    ## Accessing CR Fields

    Now that you've passed 'extra vars' to your Playbook through the CR `spec`, we need to read them from the Ansible logic that makes up your Operator.

    Variables passed in through the CR spec are made available at the top-level to be read from Jinja templates. For the CR example above, we could read the vars 'message' and 'newParameter' from a Playbook like so:

    ```
    - debug:
        msg: "message value from CR spec: {{ message }}"

    - debug:
        msg: "newParameter value from CR spec: {{ new_parameter }}"

    ```

    Did you notice anything strange about the snippet above? The 'newParameter' variable that we set on our CR spec was accessed as 'new_parameter'. Keep this automatic conversion from camelCase to snake_case in mind, as it will happen to all 'extra vars' passed into the CR spec.

    Refer to the next section for further info on reaching into the JSON structure exposed in the Ansible Operator runtime environment.

    ### JSON Structure

    When a reconciliation job runs, the content of the associated CR is made available as variables in the Ansible runtime environment.

    The JSON below is an example of what gets passed into ansible-runner (the Ansible Operator runtime).

    Note that vars added to the 'spec' section of the CR ('message' and 'new_parameter') are placed at the top-level of this structure for easy access.

    ```json
    { "meta": {
            "name": "<cr-name>",
            "namespace": "<cr-namespace>",
      },
      "message": "Hello world 2",
      "new_parameter": "newParam",
      "_app_example_com_database": {
         <Full CR>
       },
    }

    ```

    ### Accessing CR metadata

    The `meta` fields provide the CR 'name' and 'namespace' associated with a reconciliation job. These and other nested fields can be accessed with dot notation in Ansible.

    ```yaml
    - debug:
        msg: "name: {{ meta.name }}, namespace: {{ meta.namespace }}"

    ```

    In the next step, we'll use `operator-sdk` to generate our Operator project scaffolding.

  title: Create a new Operator
  assignment: |
    Next, we'll learn how to use the operator-sdk CLI to create an Ansible Operator project with the 'init' and `create` commands.

    A basic 'init' command looks like this:
    ```bash
    operator-sdk init --plugins=ansible --domain example.com
    ```
    This command tells operator-sdk to initialize a new Ansible Operator project scaffolding with the domain of your choosing.

    Among the files generated by this command is a Kubebuilder PROJECT file. Subsequent operator-sdk commands (and help text) run from the project root read this file and are aware that the project type is Ansible.

    ```bash
    operator-sdk create api -h
    ```

    After initilizating our Ansible Operator project, we run the `operator-sdk create api` command and provide the group, version, and kind of the CRD we'd like to create.

    ```bash
    operator-sdk create api --group app --version v1alpha1 --kind App --generate-role
    ```

    We should now see the following file structure:

    # Running 'operator-sdk init'
    ***
    __Now it's your turn!__ We'll be building a [__Memcached__](https://memcached.org/) Ansible Operator for the remainder of this scenario.
    ***

    Let's create a new directory for our project:

    ```
    mkdir -p $HOME/tutorial/memcached-operator
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Navigate to the directory:

    ```
    cd $HOME/tutorial/memcached-operator
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Initialize a new Ansible-based Operator SDK project for the Memcached Operator:

    ```
    operator-sdk init --plugins=ansible --domain example.com
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    Create the Memcached API and generate an Ansible role skeleton.  This will ensure our controller is setup to watch the
    Memcached resource with APIVersion 'cache.example.com/v1alpha1' and Kind 'Memcached'.

    ```
    operator-sdk create api --group cache --version v1alpha1 --kind Memcached --generate-role
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>
    ## Inspecting the results

    Inspect the memcached-operator directory structure for yourself with 'tree', and then 'cd' into it.

    ```
    tree
    ```

    ### Project Scaffolding Layout

    After creating a new operator project the directory has numerous generated folders and files. The following
    table describes a basic rundown of each generated file/directory.

    | File/Folders   | Purpose                           |
    | :---           | :--- |
    | config | Kustomize YAML definitions required to launch our controller on a cluster. It is the target directory to hold our CustomResourceDefinitions, RBAC configuration, and WebhookConfigurations.
    | Dockerfile | The container build file used to build your Ansible Operator container image. |
    | Makefile | Make targets for building and deploying your controller. |
    | molecule | Used for Ansible Based Operator Testing. See [this link](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/ansible/testing-guide/) for more information.
    | playbooks | placeholder for possible ansible playbook.
    | PROJECT | Kubebuilder metadata for scaffolding new components. |
    | requirements.yaml | requirements.yaml for defining an Ansible collection.
    | roles | Contains an Ansible Role initialized using [Ansible Galaxy](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/galaxy.html)
    | watches.yaml | Contains Group, Version, Kind, and Ansible invocation method. |

  title: Customize the Operator Logic
  assignment: |
    Up to this point, we have created the memcached-operator project specifically for watching the Memcached resource with APIVersion 'cache.example.com/v1apha1' and Kind 'Memcached'.  Now it's time to define the Operator logic.

    ## Customize the Operator logic

    For this example the memcached-operator will execute the following
    reconciliation logic for each 'Memcached' Custom Resource (CR):
    - Create a memcached Deployment if it doesn't exist
    - Ensure that the Deployment size is the same as specified by the 'Memcached'
    CR

    ## Installing an existing Role from Ansible Galaxy

    To speed development of our Operator up, we can reuse an existing Role. We will install a Role from Ansible Galaxy into our Operator:

    [dymurray.memcached_operator_role (galaxy.ansible.com)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/dymurray/memcached_operator_role)

    Run the following to install the Ansible Role inside of the project:

    ```
    ansible-galaxy install dymurray.memcached_operator_role -p ./roles
    ```

    ```
    $ ls roles/
    dymurray.memcached_operator_role memcached
    ```

    ## Removing the unneeded Role
    Since we'll be reusing the logic from 'dymurray.memcached_operator_role', we can safely delete the placeholder Role generated by the the 'operator-sdk new' command we ran previously.

    ```
    rm -rf ./roles/memcached
    ```

    ## Taking a Closer Look: dymurray.memcached_operator_role

    We can use the 'tree' command to get a general sense of the memcached Role installed from Ansible Galaxy.

    ```
    tree roles/dymurray.memcached_operator_role
    ```


    ### Role Variables
    This Role provides the user with a variable `size` which is an integer to
    control the number of Deployment replicas to create. You can find the default for this variable in the memcached Role _defaults/main.yml_ file:

    ```
    ---
    # defaults file for Memcached
    size: 1
    ```

    ### Role Tasks
    Be sure to examine the memcached Role _tasks/main.yml_ file, which uses the [_k8s_ (Kubernetes) Ansible module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/k8s_module.html)
     to create a Deployment of memcached.
    ```yaml
    ---
    # tasks file for Memcached
    - name: start memcached
      k8s:
        definition:
          kind: Deployment
          apiVersion: apps/v1
          metadata:
            name: '{{ ansible_operator_meta.name }}-memcached'
            namespace: '{{ ansible_operator_meta.namespace }}'
          spec:
            replicas: "{{size}}"
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                app: memcached

      [ ... continued ...]

    ```

    Next, we'll modify the necessary files to ensure that our Operator
    uses this Role instead of the generated scaffolding Role. Let's
    modify `watches.yaml`.

    ## Correcting the Watches File

    By default, the memcached-operator watches `Memcached` resource events as shown
    in `watches.yaml` and executes Ansible Role `Memcached`.

    Since we have swapped out the original Role for one from Ansible Galaxy, lets change the Watches file to reflect this:

    <pre class="file">
    ---
    - version: v1alpha1
      group: cache.example.com
      kind: Memcached
      role: /opt/ansible/roles/dymurray.memcached_operator_role
    </pre>

    Update this file by running the following command:

    ```
    \cp /tmp/watches.yaml watches.yaml
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>

    In the next step, we'll build and run our Ansible Operator.

  title: Create the Custom Resource Definition

    Before running the Operator, Kubernetes needs to know about the new custom
    resource definition the Operator will be watching.

    ### Deploy the Memcached Custom Resource Definition (CRD):

    ```
    oc create -f config/crd/bases/cache.example.com_memcacheds.yaml
    ```

    By running this command, we are creating a new resource type, `memcached`, on the cluster. __We will give our Operator work to do by creating and modifying resources of this type.__

    ## Ways to Run an Operator

    Once the CRD is registered, there are two ways to run the Operator:

    * As a Pod inside a Kubernetes cluster
    * As a Go program outside the cluster using Operator-SDK. This is great for local development of your Operator.

    For the sake of this tutorial, we will run the Operator as a Go program outside the cluster using Operator-SDK.

    ## Copying Roles for local development
    It is important that the Role path referenced in watches.yaml exists on
    your machine.

    To run our Operator locally, we will manually copy any Roles used by our Operator to a configured Ansible
    Roles path for our local machine (e.g /etc/ansible/roles).

    ```
    mkdir -p /opt/ansible/roles
    cp -r ~/tutorial/memcached-operator/roles/dymurray.memcached_operator_role /opt/ansible/roles/```
    `
    ```

    ## Running with 'operator-sdk run --local'

    ### Sample Commands
    Running `make run` to run an Operator locally requires a KUBECONFIG value to connect with a cluster. A sample command is shown below.

    Automatically sets KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/config
    ```sh
    $ make run
    ```

    For this scenario, we will create a new namespace/project called `tutorial`. We will then start up our Operator and ensure our operator only watches for Custom Resources within this namespace.


    ### Create the Namespace/Project
    ```
    oc new-project tutorial
    ```

    ### Start the Operator and set the WATCH_NAMESPACE variable
    ```
    WATCH_NAMESPACE=tutorial make run
    ```

    Next open a 2nd terminal window, using the "+" tab and navigate to our Operator.

    ```
    cd ~/tutorial/memcached-operator
    ```


    Now that our Operator is running, let's create a CR and deploy an instance
    of memcached.

    There is a sample CR in the scaffolding created as part of the Operator SDK:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cache.example.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Memcached
    metadata:
      name: memcached-sample
    spec:
      foo: bar
    ```

    ## Create a Memcached CR instance

    Inspect `config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml`, and then update the object to specify 3 replicas:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cache.example.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Memcached
    metadata:
      name: memcached-sample
    spec:
      size: 3
    ```

    Update this file by running the following command:

    ```
    \cp /tmp/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml
    ```
    `
    ```
    <br>

    ```
    oc --namespace tutorial create -f config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml
    ```

    ## Check that the Memcached Operator works as intended

    Ensure that the memcached-operator creates the deployment for the CR:

    ```
    oc get deployment
    ```

    Check the pods to confirm 3 replicas were created:

    ```
    oc get pods
    ```

    ## Change the Memcached CR to deploy 4 replicas

    Change the `spec.size` field in `config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml` from 3 to 4.

    <pre class="file">
    apiVersion: cache.example.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Memcached
    metadata:
      name: memcached-sample
    spec:
      size: 4
    </pre>

    ```
    oc --namespace tutorial apply -f config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml
    ```

    Confirm that the Operator changes the Deployment size:

    ```
    oc get deployment
    ```

    Inspect the YAML list of 'memcached' resources in your project, noting that the 'spec.size' field is now set to 4.

    ```
    oc get memcached  -o yaml
    ```

    ## Removing Memcached from the cluster

    First, delete the 'memcached' CR, which will remove the 4 Memcached Pods and the associated Deployment.

    ```
    oc --namespace tutorial delete -f config/samples/cache_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml
    ```

    Verify the memcached CR and deployment have been properly removed.

    ```
    oc get memcached
    ```

    ```
    oc get deployment
    ```
