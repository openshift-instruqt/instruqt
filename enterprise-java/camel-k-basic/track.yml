- assignment: 'In order to run Camel K, you will need access to an Kubernetes/OpenShift
    environment. Let''s setup the fundamentals.


    ## Logging in to the Cluster via Dashboard


    Click the [Console](https://console-openshift-console-[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com)
    tab to open the dashboard.


    You will then able able to login with admin permissions with:


    * **Username:** ``admin``

    * **Password:** ``admin``



    ## Logging in to the Cluster via CLI


    Before creating any applications, login as admin. This will be required if you
    want to log in to the web console and

    use it.


    To login to the OpenShift cluster from the _Terminal_ run:


    ```

    oc login -u admin -p admin

    ```


    This will log you in using the credentials:


    * **Username:** ``admin``

    * **Password:** ``admin``


    Use the same credentials to log into the web console.



    ## Creating your own Project


    To create a new project called ``camel-basic`` run the command:


    ```

    oc new-project camel-basic

    ```


    ## Install Camel K Operator


    ```

    oc apply -f /opt/operator-install.yaml -n camel-basic

    ```

- assignment: '## Running integrations as Kubernetes CronJobs


    The previous step can be automatically deployed as a Kubernetes CronJob if the
    delay between executions is changed into a value that can be expressed by a cron
    tab expression.


    For example, you can edit the first endpoint (`timer:java?period=3000`) in *Routing.java*
    into the following: `timer:java?period=60000` (1 minute between executions).


    Now you can run the integration again:


    ```

    kamel run camel-basic/Routing.java --property-file camel-basic/routing.properties

    ```


    Now you''ll see that Camel K has materialized a cron job (it''s might take one
    minute to appear.):


    ```

    oc get cronjob

    ```


    You''ll find a Kubernetes CronJob named "routing".


    ```

    NAME      SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE

    routing   0/1 * * * ?   False     0        39s             51s

    ```


    The running behavior changes, because now there''s no pod always running (beware
    you should not store data in memory when using the cronJob strategy).


    You can see the pods starting and being destroyed by watching the namespace:


    ```

    oc get pod -w

    ```


    Hit `ctrl+c` on the terminal window.

    To see the logs of each integration starting up, you can use the `kamel log` command:


    ```

    kamel log routing

    ```


    You should see every minute a JVM starting, executing a single operation and terminating.



    The CronJob behavior is controlled via a Trait called `cron`. Traits are the main
    way to configure high level Camel K features, to customize how integrations are
    rendered.


    To disable the cron feature and use the deployment strategy, you can run the integration
    with:


    ```

    kamel run camel-basic/Routing.java --property-file camel-basic/routing.properties
    -t cron.enabled=false

    ```



    This will disable the cron trait and restore the classic behavior (always running
    pod).


    You should see it reflected in the logs (which will be printed every minute by
    the same JVM):


    ```

    kamel log routing

    ```


    Hit `ctrl+c` on the terminal window.


    ## Congratulations


    In this scenario you got to play with Camel K. Focusing on the code, and see the
    power of how Camel K can enhance your experience when working on Kubernetes/OpenShift.
    There is much more to Camel K than realtime development and  developer joy. Be
    sure to visit [Camel K](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/index.html) to
    learn even more about the architecture and capabilities of this exciting new framework.
