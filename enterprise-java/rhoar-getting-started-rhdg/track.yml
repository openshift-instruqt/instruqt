- assignment: "# Inspect Java runtime\n\nAn appropriate Java runtime has been installed\
    \ for you. Ensure you can use it by running this command:\n\n> If the command\
    \ fails, wait a few moments and try again (it is installed in a background process\
    \ and make take a few moments depending on system load).\n\n```\n$JAVA_HOME/bin/java\
    \ --version\n```\n\nThe command should report the version in use, for example\
    \ (the versions and dates may be slightly different than the below example):\n\
    \n```console\nopenjdk 11.0.10 2021-01-19\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK\
    \ (build 11.0.10+9)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 11.0.10+9, mixed\
    \ mode)\n```\n\n## Install Operator\n\nAn [Operator](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/operators)\
    \ is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes-native application.\
    \ A Kubernetes-native application is an application that is both deployed on Kubernetes\
    \ and managed using the Kubernetes APIs and other administrative tooling.\n\n\
    Operators can be installed using the OpenShift web console, or via the command\
    \ line and YAML. For simplicity we'll use the CLI for now, and the web console\
    \ later.\n\n**1. Create namespace**\n\nFor this scenario, let's create a project\
    \ that you will use to house your application. Click:\n\n```\noc new-project dgdemo\
    \ --display-name=\"Data Grid Demo\"\n```\n\n**2. Create OperatorGroup**\n\nOperators\
    \ need an OperatorGroup to give it the necessary context and permissions to operator,\
    \ so create it by clicking this command:\n\n```\noc apply -f - << EOF\napiVersion:\
    \ operators.coreos.com/v1\nkind: OperatorGroup\nmetadata:\n name: datagrid\nspec:\n\
    \ targetNamespaces:\n - dgdemo\nEOF\n```\n`\n```\n\n**3. Create Subscription**\n\
    \nAnd now we can install the Data Grid Operator by creating a _Subscription_ to\
    \ it. Click here to do that:\n\n```\noc apply -f - << EOF\napiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1\n\
    kind: Subscription\nmetadata:\n name: datagrid-operator\nspec:\n channel: 8.2.x\n\
    \ installPlanApproval: Automatic\n name: datagrid\n source: redhat-operators\n\
    \ sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace\nEOF\n```\n`\n```\n\nWait for the Operator\
    \ to be installed using this command:\n\n```\noc rollout status -w deployment/infinispan-operator-new-deploy\n\
    ```\n\n> **NOTE**: If this command reports **Error from server (NotFound)**, it\
    \ may take a few moments to download and deploy the operator. Just wait a few\
    \ seconds and click the command again until it reports success.\n\nVerify the\
    \ Operator is installed and fully armed and operational:\n\n```\noc get pods\n\
    ```\n\nYou should see a _Running_ status as shown below:\n\n```console\nNAME \
    \                                  READY   STATUS\ninfinispan-operator-new-deploy-<id>\
    \    1/1     Running\n```\n\n**Congratulations!** In the next steps we'll make\
    \ use of this operator to do all kinds of cool things that Red Hat Data Grid can\
    \ do. On to the next step!\n"

- assignment: "## Create Data Grid Cluster\n\nWith the Data Grid Operator installed,\
    \ we can now create new Data Grid caches and services simply by creating custom\
    \ resources.\n\nLet's create our first Data Grid Cache using the OpenShift console.\
    \ To get a feel for how the web console\nworks, click this link to open the [Overview\
    \ in the OpenShift Console](https://console-openshift-console-[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/topology/ns/dgdemo/graph)\n\
    \nThe first screen you will see is the authentication screen. Enter your username\
    \ and password and\nthen log in:\n\n* Username: `admin`\n* Password: `admin`\n\
    \n![Web Console Login](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/login.png)\n\nYou'll see\
    \ the operator pod deployed:\n\n![Operator](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/opover.png)\n\
    \nSelect the _Developer View_ using the selector on the left and click **Skip\
    \ Tour** to skip the new user introduction:\n\n![Operator](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/dgdev.png)\n\
    \n### Create Data Grid Cache service\n\nWith the Operator installed, we can now\
    \ start creating instances of Data Grid.\n\nTo do so, on the [Developer View](https://console-openshift-console-[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/topology/ns/dgdemo/graph),\
    \ click **Add** on the left, and select **Operator Backed**. This will allow you\
    \ to create objects that installed Operators are looking for:\n\n![Operator](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/dgadd.png)\n\
    \nIn this case, find and click on the **Infinispan Cluster** element:\n\n![Operator](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/opcatalog.png)\n\
    \nAnd click **Create**.\n\n![Operator](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/opcreate.png)\n\
    \nHere you can configure your new Data Grid cluster (note we have not created\
    \ any Caches yet within the cluster). There are [many options described in the\
    \ docs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_data_grid/8.2/html/running_data_grid_on_openshift/index)\
    \ for security, users, and others. We'll keep it simple for this demo.\n\nChange\
    \ the name to `datagrid-service` and set the number of _replicas_ to `2`:\n\n\
    ![Operator](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/opconfig.png)\n\nFinally, scroll to\
    \ the bottom and click **Create**. You'll now see your new Data Grid cluster and\
    \ its 2 replicas spin up. Click the following command to wait for it to finish:\n\
    \n```\noc rollout status -w statefulset/datagrid-service\n```\n\n> **NOTE**: It\
    \ may take a minute or so to fully spin up, as the container images must be downloaded\
    \ the first time.\n\nNow click on the box for `datagrid-service` to see its details:\n\
    \n![Operator](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/dgdeploy.png)\n\nHere you can see\
    \ the two replicas running in 2 separate pods.\n\n## Access Data Grid Web Console\n\
    \nData Grid has a built in single-port endpoint for all network access, including\
    \ an administrative console for displaying cache configuration, statistics, and\
    \ creating/changing data in the grid. The console is accessed over the same networking\
    \ port as the grid itself. To get to it in this environment, we'll need to create\
    \ a specialized Route to it. Click the following command to create this Route:\n\
    \n```\noc apply -f - << EOF\nkind: Route\napiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1\n\
    metadata:\n  name: my-dg\nspec:\n  to:\n    kind: Service\n    name: datagrid-service\n\
    \    weight: 100\n  port:\n    targetPort: infinispan\n  tls:\n    termination:\
    \ reencrypt\n    insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Allow\n  wildcardPolicy: None\n\
    EOF\n```\n`\n```\n\nYou'll also need to get the default username/password to use\
    \ when logging into the console. Retrieve them by clicking this command:\n\n```\n\
    oc get secret datagrid-service-generated-secret -o jsonpath=\"{.data.identities\\\
    .yaml}\" | base64 --decode\n```\n\n> **NOTE**: These are default autogenerated\
    \ credentials that can be disabled or reconfigured when for production use.\n\n\
    You should now be able to click here to [connect to the Data Grid Console](https://my-dg-dgdemo.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com).\n\
    \n> **NOTE**: You may need to accept browser warnings about self-signed insecure\
    \ connections. We are not using real security certificates here for this demo!\n\
    \n![Operator](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/consolewelcome.png)\n\nClick **Open\
    \ The Console** and login using the above credentials retrieved with the `oc get\
    \ secret` command. You'll land on the home screen:\n\n![Operator](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/consolehome.png)\n\
    \nWith the console you can create caches, perform adminstrative operations, and\
    \ monitor your Data Grid clusters. We'll revisit this later to see effects of\
    \ our exercises.\n\nLet's save the password to a shell environment variable that\
    \ we'll use later. Click this command to save it to the `PASSWORD` environment\
    \ variable:\n\n```\nexport PASSWORD=$(oc get secret datagrid-service-generated-secret\
    \ -o jsonpath=\"{.data.identities\\.yaml}\" | base64 --decode | grep password\
    \ | awk '{print $2}')\n```\n\n**Congratulations** you now have Data Grid up and\
    \ running, but we haven't created any actual usable caches yet. We'll do that\
    \ in the next step.\n"

- assignment: "# Types of Data Grid services\n\nData Grid has two types of services:\n\
    \n* `Cache` Service - if you want a volatile, low-latency data store with minimal\
    \ configuration. Cache Service nodes automatically scale based on capacity pressure,\
    \ synchronously distributes and replicates but are volatile and are reset if you\
    \ reconfigure or delete the underlying Data Grid cluster.\n\n* `DataGrid` Service\
    \ - enables backing up data across global clusters using cross-site replication,\
    \ can persist data in the grid, can issue queries across caches using the Data\
    \ Grid Query API, and othert advanced features.\n\nYou might have noticed that\
    \ in our first exercise we created the Cache service (the default type) in the\
    \ upcoming exercises we will use other types.\n\n## Create cache\n\nLet's create\
    \ a simple cache in our cache service using the command line. Click on the following\
    \ to create a new Cache custom resource (this could also be done via the web console):\n\
    \n```\noc apply -f - << EOF\napiVersion: infinispan.org/v2alpha1\nkind: Cache\n\
    metadata:\n  name: mycachedefinition\nspec:\n  clusterName: datagrid-service\n\
    \  name: mycache\nEOF\n```\n`\n```\n\nThis creates a basic cache called `mycache`.\
    \ There are [many](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_data_grid/8.2/html-single/configuring_data_grid/index#cache_modes),\
    \ _many_ options for configuring caches but we'll just stick with the defaults\
    \ for now.\n\nYou can see it in the [Data Grid Admin console](https://my-dg-dgdemo.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/console),\
    \ you can see the new cache:\n\n> **NOTE**: You may need to reload the browser\
    \ page to see it!\n\n![Operator](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/dgnewcache.png)\n\
    \n## Adding data\n\nLet's add some data! We'll use the Data Grid REST interface\
    \ to add it. Click this command to add some random data to the `mycache` cache:\n\
    \n```\nfor i in {1..100} ; do\n  curl -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -k -u developer:$PASSWORD\
    \ -X POST -d \"myvalue$i\" https://my-dg-dgdemo.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/rest/v2/caches/mycache/mykey$i\n\
    \  echo \"Added mykey$i:myvalue$i\"\ndone\n```\n`\n```\n\nThis will add 100 entries\
    \ under keys `mykey1`, `mykey2`, ... with values `myvalue1`, `myvalue2`...\n\n\
    You can see the entries in the [cache overview in the admin console](https://my-dg-dgdemo.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/console/cache/mycache):\n\
    \n> You may need to click on the **Entries** tab.\n\n![Operator](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/entries.png)\n\
    \nYou can view, edit and delete these entries graphically, through REST, or other\
    \ protocols such as HotRod depending on your application and performance needs.\n\
    \n## Access via REST\n\nRed Hat Data Grid supports REST out of the box so you\
    \ can invoke cache operations with these HTTP methods:\n\n* `GET`: retrieves cache\
    \ entries.\n* `POST`: creates new cache entries under specified keys.\n* `DELETE`:\
    \ deletes cache entries.\n* `PUT`: updates cache entries.\n\nThe URLs through\
    \ which you invoke cache operations contain cache and key names. In addition,\
    \ the invocation URL contains cache name and key name in its address. You'll see\
    \ this encoding method in the example below.\n\nLet's retrieve one of our cache\
    \ entries. Click the following command:\n\n```\ncurl -k -u developer:$PASSWORD\
    \ https://my-dg-dgdemo.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/rest/v2/caches/mycache/mykey22\n\
    ```\n\nYou should see its value returned `myvalue22`.\n\nNow update it:\n\n```\n\
    curl -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -k -u developer:$PASSWORD -X PUT -d \"mynewvalue22\"\
    \ https://my-dg-dgdemo.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/rest/v2/caches/mycache/mykey22\n\
    ```\n\nThis updates the value to `mynwvalue22`. Retrieve it to verify:\n\n```\n\
    curl -k -u developer:$PASSWORD https://my-dg-dgdemo.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/rest/v2/caches/mycache/mykey22\n\
    ```\n\nNow lets delete it:\n\n```\ncurl -k -u developer:$PASSWORD -X DELETE https://my-dg-dgdemo.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/rest/v2/caches/mycache/mykey22\n\
    ```\n\nAnd retrieve it (it will fail with `HTTP 404`):\n\n```\ncurl -i -k -u developer:$PASSWORD\
    \ https://my-dg-dgdemo.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/rest/v2/caches/mycache/mykey22\n\
    ```\n\nThis demonstrates basic RESTful access to Data Grid.\n\n## Viewing metrics\n\
    \nThe admin console has built in metrics about each cache. Click the _Metrics_\
    \ tab to see them:\n\n![Operator](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/adminmetrics.png)\n\
    \nYou can also visit the [Global Metrics](https://my-dg-dgdemo.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/console/global-stats)\
    \ screen to see more info about the Data Grid service as a whole, and confirm\
    \ cluster status and the 2 replicas on the [Cluster Membership](https://my-dg-dgdemo.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/console/cluster-membership)\

description: '## Learning Objectives


  This interactive tutorial shows you how to deploy and run a single instance of [RHDG](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/data-grid)
  Red Hat Data Grid on OpenShift.


  You then learn how to expose the REST endpoint and invoke simple cache operations.


  ## Introduction to Red Hat Data Grid


  ![Logo](/openshift/assets/middleware/dg/logo.png)


  Red Hat Data Grid (RHDG) is an open source, in-memory data store that:


  * Stores data in memory (RAM) to provide fast, low-latency response times and very
  high throughput.

  * Synchronizes data across multiple nodes for continuous availability, reliability,
  and elastic scalability.

  * Offers flexibility. You can use it as a distributed cache, NoSQL database, or
  event broker.


  RHDG capabilities improve application performance and scalability while reducing
  the need to make expensive calls to database management systems and transactional
  back ends.
