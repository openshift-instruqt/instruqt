challenges:
- assignment: "To get started, first we need to login to OpenShift.\n\n### Logging\
    \ in to the Cluster via OpenShift CLI\n\nTo login to the OpenShift cluster use\
    \ the following commmand in your **_Terminal_**:\n\n```\noc login -u admin -p\
    \ admin\n```\n\n> You can click on the above command (and all others in this scenario)\
    \ to automatically copy it into the terminal and execute it.\n\nThis will log\
    \ you in using the credentials:\n\n* **Username:** ``admin``\n* **Password:**\
    \ ``admin``\n\nYou should see the output:\n\n```bash\nLogin successful.\n\nYou\
    \ don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running\n\n\
    \    oc new-project <projectname>\n```\n\nFor this scenario lets create a project\
    \ called ``messaging`` by running the command:\n\n```\noc new-project messaging\n\
    ```\n\nYou should see output similar to:\n\n```bash\nNow using project \"messaging\"\
    \ on server \"https://172.17.0.41:8443\".\n\nYou can add applications to this\
    \ project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:\n\n    oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git\n\
    \nto build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple\
    \ Kubernetes application:\n\n    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node\n\
    ```\n\n### Install AMQ broker operator\n\nAMQ Broker provides container images\
    \ and Operators for running ActiveMQ Artemis on OpenShift.\n\nDeploy the Operator\
    \ Lifecycle Manager Operator Group and Susbcription to easily install the operator\
    \ in the previously created namespace:\n\n```\noc -n messaging apply -f /opt/operator-install.yaml\n\
    ```\n\nYou should see the following result:\n\n```bash\noperatorgroup.operators.coreos.com/broker-operatorgroup\
    \ created\nsubscription.operators.coreos.com/amq-broker created\n```\n\n> You\
    \ can also deploy the AMQ broker operator from the OpenShift OperatorHub from\
    \ within the administration console.\n\n### Check operator deployment\n\nFollow\
    \ up the operator deployment to validate it is running.\n\nTo watch the pods status\
    \ run the following command:\n\n```\noc -n messaging get pods -w\n```\n\nYou will\
    \ see the status of the operator changing until it gets to `running`. It should\
    \ look similar to the following:\n\n```bash\nNAME                            \

- assignment: 'With the project space now available, let''s create the broker instance.


    ### Inspect the ActiveMQArtermis custom resource


    Click the link below to open the custom resource (CR) definition for the cluster:


    * `amq-broker.yaml`{{open}}


    As you can see, we are enabling just one single acceptor and configuring it to
    accept incomming `AMQP` connections in the default `5672` port.


    We are also enabling the _console_ and exposing the endpoints for external access
    too.


    ### Creating an AMQ broker


    Switch to the application directory in the command line by issuing the following
    command:


    ```cd /root/projects/amq-examples/amq-js-demo```{{execute interrupt}}


    Create a new broker using the OpenShift command:


    ```

    oc -n messaging apply -f amq-broker.yaml

    ```


    This command will create a broker customer resource, the operator then will take
    notice of the desired state and will create the required deployment and resources
    missing to run a new instance.


    You should see the output:


    ```bash

    activemqartemis.broker.amq.io/broker created

    ```


    ### Check broker deployment


    Follow up the AMQ broker deployment to validate it is running.


    To watch the pods status run the following command:


    ```

    oc -n messaging get pods -w

    ```


    You will see the pod for the broker StatefulSet changing the status to `running`.
    It should look similar to the following:


    ```bash

    NAME                                  READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE

    amq-broker-operator-6c76986f9-brl67   1/1     Running             0          15m

    broker-ss-0                           0/1     ContainerCreating   0          5s

    broker-ss-0                           0/1     ContainerCreating   0          6s

    broker-ss-0                           0/1     Running             0          25s

    broker-ss-0                           1/1     Running             0          57s

    ```


    Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the process.


    `^C`{{execute ctrl-seq}}


    When the provisioning of the broker finishes, you will be set to start using the
    service. In the next step you will deploy a simple messging application.

    \ a set of open source cloud native application runtimes for modern applications.\n\
    \nThe app implements a simple messaging greeting service that simply sends a Hello\

    \ messages. We use the Red Hat AMQ JavaScript Client to create a connection to\
    \ the messaging broker to send and receive messages.\n\n> The AMQ Clients is a\
    \ suite of AMQP 1.0 messaging APIs that allow you to make any application a messaging\
    \ application. It includes both industry-standard APIs such as JMS and new event-driven\
    \ APIs that make it easy to integrate messaging anywhere. The AMQ Javascript Client\

    ### Check the application logs


    Now that the application is up and running you can check the logs to check how
    is everything going on.


    Let''s use the OpenShift CLI tool to connect with the deployment and view the
    pod''s log.


    Use the following command to retrieve the logs:


    `oc -n messaging logs -f dc/amq-js-demo`{{execute interrupt}}


    You will see a message every 10 seconds with the following text:


    ``Message received: {"id":1,"text":"Hello World!","timestamp":1605814628546}``


    This message is been sent and received to the ``example`` queue by the application
    you just deployed.

    \ for Internet-scale applications. AMQ components use industry-standard message\
    \ protocols and support a wide range of programming languages and operating environments.\
    \ AMQ gives you the strong foundation you need to build modern distributed applications.\n\
    \n## What is AMQ Broker?\n\nAMQ Broker is a pure-Java multiprotocol message broker.\
    \ It\u2019s built on an efficient, asynchronous core, with a fast native journal\
    \ for message persistence and the option of shared-nothing state replication for\
    \ high availability.\n\n* **Persistence** - A fast, native-IO journal or a JDBC-based\
    \ store\n* **High availability** - Shared store or shared-nothing state replication\n\
    * **Advanced queueing** - Last value queues, message groups, topic hierarchies,\
    \ and large message support\n* **Multiprotocol** - AMQP 1.0, MQTT, STOMP, OpenWire,\
    \ and HornetQ Core\n\nAMQ Broker is based on the [Apache ActiveMQ Artemis](https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/)\
