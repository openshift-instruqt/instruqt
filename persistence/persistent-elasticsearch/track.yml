    admin` user, verify by running `oc whoami

    ``` on the command line.


    > You can click on the above command (and all others in this scenario) to automatically
    copy it into the terminal and execute it.


    - Create a new project, that we will use throughout this scenario and create a
    PersistentVolumeClaim on ODF storage class which will be used by Elasticsearch
    pod to persist data


    ```

    oc create -f 1_create_ns_ocs_pvc.yaml

    ```


    ```

    oc project e-library

    ```


    - To verify get the Storage Class (SC) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)


    ```

    oc get pvc

    ```


    ```

    oc get sc

    ```


    - With just a few lines of YAML, you have created a PVC named `ocs-pv-claim` on
    storage class `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` which is provisioned from OpenShift
    Container Storage. Elasticsearch needs persistence for its data and OpenShift
    Container Storage is one of the simplest and reliable option that you can choose
    to persist data for you apps running on OpenShift Container Platform.

    - Let''s continue to the next section to deploy the Elasticsearch cluster.

    > Note : Hang Tight ! The data ingestion could take a few minutes.


    ```

    oc exec -it e-library-backend-api -n e-library -- curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/load_data

    ```


    > Here the ingested data is getting stored on Elasticsearch shards which are in-turn
    using ODF PVC for persistence.


    - As soon as the data is ingested, Elasticsearch will index that and make it search-able.

    - Grab the frontend URL and open that in your web-browser to search for any random
    words.

    - _URL_ http://frontend-e-library.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com


    ```

    oc get route frontend -n e-library

    ```


    - Elasticsearch real-time search capabilities, instantly searches a large dataset.
    Thus making it a popular choice for logging,metrics,full-text search, etc. use
    cases.


    ## Final Thoughts


    Elasticsearch offers replication at per index level to provide some data resilience.
    Additional data resilience can be provided by deploying Elasticsearch on top of
    a reliable storage service layer such as OpenShift Container Storage which offers
    further resilience capabilities. This additional data resilience can enhance Elasticsearch
    service availability during broader infrastructure failure scenarios. Because
    of limited system resources available in this lab environment, we could not demonstrate
    the enhanced resiliency capabilities of Elasticsearch when deployed on OpenShift
    Container Storage, but you have got the idea :)


    Happy Persistency \o

  \ Storage helps teams develop and deploy applications quickly and efficiently across\

  \ Persistent Volumes and use that for deploying Elasticsearch. You will then deploy\
  \ a demo app which is a e-library search engin for 100 classic novels. Once the\
  \ app is successfully deployed, you could search any word from 100 classic novels,\
  \ the search is powered by Elasticsearch which is using persistent storage from\
  \ ODF. The logical architecture of the app that you will deploy looks like this\n\
